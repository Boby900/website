## DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY

DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY — remove a text search dictionary

## Synopsis

```

DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY` drops an existing text search dictionary. To execute this command you must be the owner of the dictionary.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the text search dictionary does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing text search dictionary.

* `CASCADE`

    Automatically drop objects that depend on the text search dictionary, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.14](ddl-depend.html "5.14. Dependency Tracking")).

* `RESTRICT`

    Refuse to drop the text search dictionary if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

Remove the text search dictionary `english`:

```

DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english;
```

This command will not succeed if there are any existing text search configurations that use the dictionary. Add `CASCADE` to drop such configurations along with the dictionary.

## Compatibility

There is no `DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY` statement in the SQL standard.
