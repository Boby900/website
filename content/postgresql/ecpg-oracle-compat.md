## 36.16.Â Oracle Compatibility Mode [#](#ECPG-ORACLE-COMPAT)

`ecpg` can be run in a so-called *Oracle compatibility mode*. If this mode is active, it tries to behave as if it were Oracle Pro\*C.

Specifically, this mode changes `ecpg` in three ways:

* Pad character arrays receiving character string types with trailing spaces to the specified length
* Zero byte terminate these character arrays, and set the indicator variable if truncation occurs
* Set the null indicator to `-1` when character arrays receive empty character string types
