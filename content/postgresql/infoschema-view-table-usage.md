## 37.65. `view_table_usage` [#](#INFOSCHEMA-VIEW-TABLE-USAGE)

The view `view_table_usage` identifies all tables that are used in the query expression of a view (the `SELECT` statement that defines the view). A table is only included if that table is owned by a currently enabled role.

### Note

System tables are not included. This should be fixed sometime.
