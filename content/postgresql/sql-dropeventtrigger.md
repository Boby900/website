## DROP EVENT TRIGGER

DROP EVENT TRIGGER — remove an event trigger

## Synopsis

```

DROP EVENT TRIGGER [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP EVENT TRIGGER` removes an existing event trigger. To execute this command, the current user must be the owner of the event trigger.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the event trigger does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name of the event trigger to remove.

* `CASCADE`

    Automatically drop objects that depend on the trigger, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.14](ddl-depend.html "5.14. Dependency Tracking")).

* `RESTRICT`

    Refuse to drop the trigger if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

Destroy the trigger `snitch`:

```

DROP EVENT TRIGGER snitch;
```

## Compatibility

There is no `DROP EVENT TRIGGER` statement in the SQL standard.
