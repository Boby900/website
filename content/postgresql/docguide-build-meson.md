## J.4.Â Building the Documentation with Meson [#](#DOCGUIDE-BUILD-MESON)

Two options are provided for building the documentation using Meson. Change to the `build` directory before running one of these commands, or add `-C build` to the command.

To build just the HTML version of the documentation:

```

build$ ninja docs
```

To build all forms of the documentation:

```

build$ ninja alldocs
```

The output appears in the subdirectory `build/doc/src/sgml`.
