## Description

`DISCONNECT` closes a connection (or all connections) to the database.

## Parameters

* *`connection_name`* [#](#ECPG-SQL-DISCONNECT-CONNECTION-NAME)

    A database connection name established by the `CONNECT` command.

* `CURRENT` [#](#ECPG-SQL-DISCONNECT-CURRENT)

    Close the “current” connection, which is either the most recently opened connection, or the connection set by the `SET CONNECTION` command. This is also the default if no argument is given to the `DISCONNECT` command.

int
main(void)
{
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb AS DEFAULT USER testuser;
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb AS con1 USER testuser;
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb AS con2 USER testuser;
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb AS con3 USER testuser;

    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT CURRENT;  /* close con3          */
    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT DEFAULT;  /* close DEFAULT       */
    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT ALL;      /* close con2 and con1 */

    return 0;
