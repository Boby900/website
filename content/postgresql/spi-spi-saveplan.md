## SPI\_saveplan

SPI\_saveplan â€” save a prepared statement

## Synopsis

```

SPIPlanPtr SPI_saveplan(SPIPlanPtr plan)
```

## Description

`SPI_saveplan` copies a passed statement (prepared by `SPI_prepare`) into memory that will not be freed by `SPI_finish` nor by the transaction manager, and returns a pointer to the copied statement. This gives you the ability to reuse prepared statements in the subsequent invocations of your C function in the current session.

## Arguments

* `SPIPlanPtr plan`

    the prepared statement to be saved

## Return Value

Pointer to the copied statement; or `NULL` if unsuccessful. On error, `SPI_result` is set thus:

* `SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT`

    if *`plan`* is `NULL` or invalid

* `SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED`

    if called from an unconnected C function

## Notes

The originally passed-in statement is not freed, so you might wish to do `SPI_freeplan` on it to avoid leaking memory until `SPI_finish`.

In most cases, `SPI_keepplan` is preferred to this function, since it accomplishes largely the same result without needing to physically copy the prepared statement's data structures.
