## 49.7. Logical Decoding Output Writers [#](#LOGICALDECODING-WRITER)

Essentially, three functions need to be provided: one to read WAL, one to prepare writing output, and one to write the output (see [Section 49.6.5](logicaldecoding-output-plugin.html#LOGICALDECODING-OUTPUT-PLUGIN-OUTPUT "49.6.5. Functions for Producing Output")).
