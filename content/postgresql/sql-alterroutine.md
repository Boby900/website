## Description

`ALTER ROUTINE` changes the definition of a routine, which can be an aggregate function, a normal function, or a procedure. See under [ALTER AGGREGATE](sql-alteraggregate.html "ALTER AGGREGATE"), [ALTER FUNCTION](sql-alterfunction.html "ALTER FUNCTION"), and [ALTER PROCEDURE](sql-alterprocedure.html "ALTER PROCEDURE") for the description of the parameters, more examples, and further details.

## Examples

To rename the routine `foo` for type `integer` to `foobar`:

```

ALTER ROUTINE foo(integer) RENAME TO foobar;
```

This command will work independent of whether `foo` is an aggregate, function, or procedure.

## Compatibility

This statement is partially compatible with the `ALTER ROUTINE` statement in the SQL standard. See under [ALTER FUNCTION](sql-alterfunction.html "ALTER FUNCTION") and [ALTER PROCEDURE](sql-alterprocedure.html "ALTER PROCEDURE") for more details. Allowing routine names to refer to aggregate functions is a PostgreSQL extension.

Note that there is no `CREATE ROUTINE` command.
