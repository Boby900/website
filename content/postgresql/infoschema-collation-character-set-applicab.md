## 37.11. `collation_character_set_​applicability` [#](#INFOSCHEMA-COLLATION-CHARACTER-SET-APPLICAB)

The view `collation_character_set_applicability` identifies which character set the available collations are applicable to. In PostgreSQL, there is only one character set per database (see explanation in [Section 37.7](infoschema-character-sets.html "37.7. character_sets")), so this view does not provide much useful information.
