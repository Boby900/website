## 75.5.Â Structure of the Bootstrap BKI File [#](#BKI-STRUCTURE)

The `open` command cannot be used until the tables it uses exist and have entries for the table that is to be opened. (These minimum tables are `pg_class`, `pg_attribute`, `pg_proc`, and `pg_type`.) To allow those tables themselves to be filled, `create` with the `bootstrap` option implicitly opens the created table for data insertion.

Also, the `declare index` and `declare toast` commands cannot be used until the system catalogs they need have been created and filled in.

Thus, the structure of the `postgres.bki` file has to be:

1. `create bootstrap` one of the critical tables
2. `insert` data describing at least the critical tables
3. `close`
4. Repeat for the other critical tables.
5. `create` (without `bootstrap`) a noncritical table
6. `open`
7. `insert` desired data
8. `close`
9. Repeat for the other noncritical tables.
10. Define indexes and toast tables.
11. `build indices`

There are doubtless other, undocumented ordering dependencies.
