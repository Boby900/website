## 53.64. `pg_type` [#](#CATALOG-PG-TYPE)

| `typtype` `char``typtype` is `b` for a base type, `c` for a composite type (e.g., a table's row type), `d` for a domain, `e` for an enum type, `p` for a pseudo-type, `r` for a range type, or `m` for a multirange type. See also `typrelid` and `typbasetype`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `typcategory` `char``typcategory` is an arbitrary classification of data types that is used by the parser to determine which implicit casts should be “preferred”. See [Table 53.65](catalog-pg-type.html#CATALOG-TYPCATEGORY-TABLE "Table 53.65. typcategory Codes").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `typispreferred` `bool`True if the type is a preferred cast target within its `typcategory`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `typisdefined` `bool`True if the type is defined, false if this is a placeholder entry for a not-yet-defined type. When `typisdefined` is false, nothing except the type name, namespace, and OID can be relied on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `typdelim` `char`Character that separates two values of this type when parsing array input. Note that the delimiter is associated with the array element data type, not the array data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `typrelid` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class.html "53.11. pg_class").`oid`)If this is a composite type (see `typtype`), then this column points to the [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class.html "53.11. pg_class") entry that defines the corresponding table. (For a free-standing composite type, the [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class.html "53.11. pg_class") entry doesn't really represent a table, but it is needed anyway for the type's [`pg_attribute`](catalog-pg-attribute.html "53.7. pg_attribute") entries to link to.) Zero for non-composite types.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `typsubscript` `regproc` (references [`pg_proc`](catalog-pg-proc.html "53.39. pg_proc").`oid`)Subscripting handler function's OID, or zero if this type doesn't support subscripting. Types that are “true” array types have `typsubscript` = `array_subscript_handler`, but other types may have other handler functions to implement specialized subscripting behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `typelem` `oid` (references [`pg_type`](catalog-pg-type.html "53.64. pg_type").`oid`)If `typelem` is not zero then it identifies another row in `pg_type`, defining the type yielded by subscripting. This should be zero if `typsubscript` is zero. However, it can be zero when `typsubscript` isn't zero, if the handler doesn't need `typelem` to determine the subscripting result type. Note that a `typelem` dependency is considered to imply physical containment of the element type in this type; so DDL changes on the element type might be restricted by the presence of this type.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `typarray` `oid` (references [`pg_type`](catalog-pg-type.html "53.64. pg_type").`oid`)If `typarray` is not zero then it identifies another row in `pg_type`, which is the “true” array type having this type as element                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `typalign` `char``typalign` is the alignment required when storing a value of this type. It applies to storage on disk as well as most representations of the value inside PostgreSQL. When multiple values are stored consecutively, such as in the representation of a complete row on disk, padding is inserted before a datum of this type so that it begins on the specified boundary. The alignment reference is the beginning of the first datum in the sequence. Possible values are:*   `c` = `char` alignment, i.e., no alignment needed.

* `s` = `short` alignment (2 bytes on most machines).

* ` = `int` alignment (4 bytes on most machines).

* = `double` alignment (8 bytes on many machines, but by no means all).                            |

| orage``char``typstorage` tells for varlena types (those with `typlen`= -1) if the type is prepared for toasting and what the default strategy for attributes of this type should be. Possible values are:*`p` (plain): Values must always be stored plain (non-varlena types always use this value).

* xternal): Values can be stored in a secondary “TOAST” relation (if relation has one, see `pg_class.reltoastrelid`).

* n): Values can be compressed and stored inline.

* ded): Values can be compressed and/or moved to a secondary relation.`x` is the usual choice for toast-able types. Note that `m` values can also be moved out to secondary storage, but only as a last resort (`e` and `x` values are moved first). |

### Note

For fixed-width types used in system tables, it is critical that the size and alignment defined in `pg_type` agree with the way that the compiler will lay out the column in a structure representing a table row.
