## 53.49. `pg_shdescription` [#](#CATALOG-PG-SHDESCRIPTION)

The catalog `pg_shdescription` stores optional descriptions (comments) for shared database objects. Descriptions can be manipulated with the [`COMMENT`](sql-comment.html "COMMENT") command and viewed with psql's `\d` commands.

See also [`pg_description`](catalog-pg-description.html "53.19. pg_description"), which performs a similar function for descriptions involving objects within a single database.

Unlike most system catalogs, `pg_shdescription` is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of `pg_shdescription` per cluster, not one per database.
