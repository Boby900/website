## DROP USER MAPPING

DROP USER MAPPING â€” remove a user mapping for a foreign server

## Synopsis

```

DROP USER MAPPING [ IF EXISTS ] FOR { user_name | USER | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC } SERVER server_name
```

## Description

`DROP USER MAPPING` removes an existing user mapping from foreign server.

The owner of a foreign server can drop user mappings for that server for any user. Also, a user can drop a user mapping for their own user name if `USAGE` privilege on the server has been granted to the user.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the user mapping does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`user_name`*

    User name of the mapping. `CURRENT_ROLE`, `CURRENT_USER`, and `USER` match the name of the current user. `PUBLIC` is used to match all present and future user names in the system.

* *`server_name`*

    Server name of the user mapping.

## Examples

Drop a user mapping `bob`, server `foo` if it exists:

```

DROP USER MAPPING IF EXISTS FOR bob SERVER foo;
```

## Compatibility

`DROP USER MAPPING` conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). The `IF EXISTS` clause is a PostgreSQL extension.
