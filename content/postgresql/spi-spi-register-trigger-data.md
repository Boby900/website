## SPI\_register\_trigger\_data

SPI\_register\_trigger\_data â€” make ephemeral trigger data available in SPI queries

## Synopsis

```

int SPI_register_trigger_data(TriggerData *tdata)
```

## Description

`SPI_register_trigger_data` makes any ephemeral relations captured by a trigger available to queries planned and executed through the current SPI connection. Currently, this means the transition tables captured by an `AFTER` trigger defined with a `REFERENCING OLD/NEW TABLE AS` ... clause. This function should be called by a PL trigger handler function after connecting.

## Arguments

* `TriggerData *tdata`

    the `TriggerData` object passed to a trigger handler function as `fcinfo->context`

## Return Value

If the execution of the command was successful then the following (nonnegative) value will be returned:

* `SPI_OK_TD_REGISTER`

    if the captured trigger data (if any) has been successfully registered

On error, one of the following negative values is returned:

* `SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT`

    if *`tdata`* is `NULL`

* `SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED`

    if called from an unconnected C function

* `SPI_ERROR_REL_DUPLICATE`

    if the name of any trigger data transient relation is already registered for this connection
