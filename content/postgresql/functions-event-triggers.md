### 9.29.1. Capturing Changes at Command End [#](#PG-EVENT-TRIGGER-DDL-COMMAND-END-FUNCTIONS)

```

pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands () → setof record
```

`pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands` returns a list of DDL commands executed by each user action, when invoked in a function attached to a `ddl_command_end` event trigger. If called in any other context, an error is raised. `pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands` returns one row for each base command executed; some commands that are a single SQL sentence may return more than one row. This function returns the following columns:

| Name              | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `command_tag`     | `text`           | Command tag                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `schema_name`     | `text`           | Name of the schema the object belongs in, if any; otherwise `NULL`. No quoting is applied.                                                                                                         |
| `object_identity` | `text`           | Text rendering of the object identity, schema-qualified. Each identifier included in the identity is quoted if necessary.                                                                          |

The `pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects` function can be used in an event trigger like this:

```

CREATE FUNCTION test_event_trigger_for_drops()
        RETURNS event_trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
    obj record;
BEGIN
    FOR obj IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects()
    LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE '% dropped object: % %.% %',
                     tg_tag,
                     obj.object_type,
                     obj.schema_name,
                     obj.object_name,
                     obj.object_identity;
    END LOOP;
END;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER test_event_trigger_for_drops
   ON sql_drop
   EXECUTE FUNCTION test_event_trigger_for_drops();
```

### 9.29.3. Handling a Table Rewrite Event [#](#PG-EVENT-TRIGGER-TABLE-REWRITE-FUNCTIONS)

The functions shown in [Table 9.104](functions-event-triggers.html#FUNCTIONS-EVENT-TRIGGER-TABLE-REWRITE "Table 9.104. Table Rewrite Information Functions") provide information about a table for which a `table_rewrite` event has just been called. If called in any other context, an error is raised.

| `pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid` () → `oid`Returns the OID of the table about to be rewritten.                                                                |
| `pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_reason` () → `integer`Returns a code explaining the reason(s) for rewriting. The exact meaning of the codes is release dependent. |

These functions can be used in an event trigger like this:

```

CREATE FUNCTION test_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid()
