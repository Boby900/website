## 54.32. `pg_timezone_names` [#](#VIEW-PG-TIMEZONE-NAMES)

The view `pg_timezone_names` provides a list of time zone names that are recognized by `SET TIMEZONE`, along with their associated abbreviations, UTC offsets, and daylight-savings status. (Technically, PostgreSQL does not use UTC because leap seconds are not handled.) Unlike the abbreviations shown in [`pg_timezone_abbrevs`](view-pg-timezone-abbrevs.html "54.31. pg_timezone_abbrevs"), many of these names imply a set of daylight-savings transition date rules. Therefore, the associated information changes across local DST boundaries. The displayed information is computed based on the current value of `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.
