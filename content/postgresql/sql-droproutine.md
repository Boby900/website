## DROP ROUTINE

DROP ROUTINE — remove a routine

## Synopsis

```

DROP ROUTINE [ IF EXISTS ] name [ ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [, ...] ] ) ] [, ...]
    [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP ROUTINE` removes the definition of one or more existing routines. The term “routine” includes aggregate functions, normal functions, and procedures. See under [DROP AGGREGATE](sql-dropaggregate.html "DROP AGGREGATE"), [DROP FUNCTION](sql-dropfunction.html "DROP FUNCTION"), and [DROP PROCEDURE](sql-dropprocedure.html "DROP PROCEDURE") for the description of the parameters, more examples, and further details.

## Notes

The lookup rules used by `DROP ROUTINE` are fundamentally the same as for `DROP PROCEDURE`; in particular, `DROP ROUTINE` shares that command's behavior of considering an argument list that has no *`argmode`* markers to be possibly using the SQL standard's definition that `OUT` arguments are included in the list. (`DROP AGGREGATE` and `DROP FUNCTION` do not do that.)

In some cases where the same name is shared by routines of different kinds, it is possible for `DROP ROUTINE` to fail with an ambiguity error when a more specific command (`DROP FUNCTION`, etc.) would work. Specifying the argument type list more carefully will also resolve such problems.

These lookup rules are also used by other commands that act on existing routines, such as `ALTER ROUTINE` and `COMMENT ON ROUTINE`.

## Examples

To drop the routine `foo` for type `integer`:

```

DROP ROUTINE foo(integer);
```

This command will work independent of whether `foo` is an aggregate, function, or procedure.

## Compatibility

This command conforms to the SQL standard, with these PostgreSQL extensions:

* The standard only allows one routine to be dropped per command.
* The `IF EXISTS` option is an extension.
* The ability to specify argument modes and names is an extension, and the lookup rules differ when modes are given.
* User-definable aggregate functions are an extension.
