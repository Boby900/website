## LOAD

LOAD — load a shared library file

## Synopsis

```

LOAD 'filename'
```

## Description

This command loads a shared library file into the PostgreSQL server's address space. If the file has been loaded already, the command does nothing. Shared library files that contain C functions are automatically loaded whenever one of their functions is called. Therefore, an explicit `LOAD` is usually only needed to load a library that modifies the server's behavior through “hooks” rather than providing a set of functions.

The library file name is typically given as just a bare file name, which is sought in the server's library search path (set by [dynamic\_library\_path](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH)). Alternatively it can be given as a full path name. In either case the platform's standard shared library file name extension may be omitted. See [Section 38.10.1](xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-C-DYNLOAD "38.10.1. Dynamic Loading") for more information on this topic.

Non-superusers can only apply `LOAD` to library files located in `$libdir/plugins/` — the specified *`filename`* must begin with exactly that string. (It is the database administrator's responsibility to ensure that only “safe” libraries are installed there.)

## Compatibility

`LOAD` is a PostgreSQL extension.
