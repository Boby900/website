## 20.15. Preset Options [#](#RUNTIME-CONFIG-PRESET)

The following “parameters” are read-only. As such, they have been excluded from the sample `postgresql.conf` file. These options report various aspects of PostgreSQL behavior that might be of interest to certain applications, particularly administrative front-ends. Most of them are determined when PostgreSQL is compiled or when it is installed.

* `block_size` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-BLOCK-SIZE)

    Reports the size of a disk block. It is determined by the value of `BLCKSZ` when building the server. The default value is 8192 bytes. The meaning of some configuration variables (such as [shared\_buffers](runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS)) is influenced by `block_size`. See [Section 20.4](runtime-config-resource.html "20.4. Resource Consumption") for information.

* `data_checksums` (`boolean`) [#](#GUC-DATA-CHECKSUMS)

    Reports whether data checksums are enabled for this cluster. See [data checksums](app-initdb.html#APP-INITDB-DATA-CHECKSUMS) for more information.

* `data_directory_mode` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-DATA-DIRECTORY-MODE)

    On Unix systems this parameter reports the permissions the data directory (defined by [data\_directory](runtime-config-file-locations.html#GUC-DATA-DIRECTORY)) had at server startup. (On Microsoft Windows this parameter will always display `0700`.) See [group access](app-initdb.html#APP-INITDB-ALLOW-GROUP-ACCESS) for more information.

* `debug_assertions` (`boolean`) [#](#GUC-DEBUG-ASSERTIONS)

    Reports whether PostgreSQL has been built with assertions enabled. That is the case if the macro `USE_ASSERT_CHECKING` is defined when PostgreSQL is built (accomplished e.g., by the `configure` option `--enable-cassert`). By default PostgreSQL is built without assertions.

* `huge_pages_status` (`enum`) [#](#GUC-HUGE-PAGES-STATUS)

    Reports the state of huge pages in the current instance: `on`, `off`, or `unknown` (if displayed with `postgres -C`). This parameter is useful to determine whether allocation of huge pages was successful under `huge_pages=try`. See [huge\_pages](runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-HUGE-PAGES) for more information.

* `integer_datetimes` (`boolean`) [#](#GUC-INTEGER-DATETIMES)

    Reports whether PostgreSQL was built with support for 64-bit-integer dates and times. As of PostgreSQL 10, this is always `on`.

* `in_hot_standby` (`boolean`) [#](#GUC-IN-HOT-STANDBY)

    Reports whether the server is currently in hot standby mode. When this is `on`, all transactions are forced to be read-only. Within a session, this can change only if the server is promoted to be primary. See [Section 27.4](hot-standby.html "27.4. Hot Standby") for more information.

* `max_function_args` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-MAX-FUNCTION-ARGS)

    Reports the maximum number of function arguments. It is determined by the value of `FUNC_MAX_ARGS` when building the server. The default value is 100 arguments.

* `max_identifier_length` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-MAX-IDENTIFIER-LENGTH)

    Reports the maximum identifier length. It is determined as one less than the value of `NAMEDATALEN` when building the server. The default value of `NAMEDATALEN` is 64; therefore the default `max_identifier_length` is 63 bytes, which can be less than 63 characters when using multibyte encodings.

* `max_index_keys` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-MAX-INDEX-KEYS)

    Reports the maximum number of index keys. It is determined by the value of `INDEX_MAX_KEYS` when building the server. The default value is 32 keys.

* `segment_size` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-SEGMENT-SIZE)

    Reports the number of blocks (pages) that can be stored within a file segment. It is determined by the value of `RELSEG_SIZE` when building the server. The maximum size of a segment file in bytes is equal to `segment_size` multiplied by `block_size`; by default this is 1GB.

* `server_encoding` (`string`) [#](#GUC-SERVER-ENCODING)

    Reports the database encoding (character set). It is determined when the database is created. Ordinarily, clients need only be concerned with the value of [client\_encoding](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-CLIENT-ENCODING).

* `server_version` (`string`) [#](#GUC-SERVER-VERSION)

    Reports the version number of the server. It is determined by the value of `PG_VERSION` when building the server.

* `server_version_num` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-SERVER-VERSION-NUM)

    Reports the version number of the server as an integer. It is determined by the value of `PG_VERSION_NUM` when building the server.

* `shared_memory_size` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-SHARED-MEMORY-SIZE)

    Reports the size of the main shared memory area, rounded up to the nearest megabyte.

* `shared_memory_size_in_huge_pages` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-SHARED-MEMORY-SIZE-IN-HUGE-PAGES)

    Reports the number of huge pages that are needed for the main shared memory area based on the specified [huge\_page\_size](runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-HUGE-PAGE-SIZE). If huge pages are not supported, this will be `-1`.

    This setting is supported only on Linux. It is always set to `-1` on other platforms. For more details about using huge pages on Linux, see [Section 19.4.5](kernel-resources.html#LINUX-HUGE-PAGES "19.4.5. Linux Huge Pages").

* `ssl_library` (`string`) [#](#GUC-SSL-LIBRARY)

    Reports the name of the SSL library that this PostgreSQL server was built with (even if SSL is not currently configured or in use on this instance), for example `OpenSSL`, or an empty string if none.

* `wal_block_size` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-WAL-BLOCK-SIZE)

    Reports the size of a WAL disk block. It is determined by the value of `XLOG_BLCKSZ` when building the server. The default value is 8192 bytes.

* `wal_segment_size` (`integer`) [#](#GUC-WAL-SEGMENT-SIZE)

    Reports the size of write ahead log segments. The default value is 16MB. See [Section 30.5](wal-configuration.html "30.5. WAL Configuration") for more information.
