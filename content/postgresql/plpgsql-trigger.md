## 43.10. Trigger Functions [#](#PLPGSQL-TRIGGER)

  * *   [43.10.1. Triggers on Data Changes](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER)
  * [43.10.2. Triggers on Events](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-EVENT-TRIGGER)

PL/pgSQL can be used to define trigger functions on data changes or database events. A trigger function is created with the `CREATE FUNCTION` command, declaring it as a function with no arguments and a return type of `trigger` (for data change triggers) or `event_trigger` (for database event triggers). Special local variables named `TG_something` are automatically defined to describe the condition that triggered the call.

### 43.10.1. Triggers on Data Changes [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER)

A [data change trigger](triggers.html "Chapter 39. Triggers") is declared as a function with no arguments and a return type of `trigger`. Note that the function must be declared with no arguments even if it expects to receive some arguments specified in `CREATE TRIGGER` — such arguments are passed via `TG_ARGV`, as described below.

When a PL/pgSQL function is called as a trigger, several special variables are created automatically in the top-level block. They are:

* `NEW` `record` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-NEW)

    new database row for `INSERT`/`UPDATE` operations in row-level triggers. This variable is null in statement-level triggers and for `DELETE` operations.

* `OLD` `record` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-OLD)

    old database row for `UPDATE`/`DELETE` operations in row-level triggers. This variable is null in statement-level triggers and for `INSERT` operations.

* `TG_NAME` `name` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-NAME)

    name of the trigger which fired.

* `TG_WHEN` `text` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-WHEN)

    `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, or `INSTEAD OF`, depending on the trigger's definition.

* `TG_LEVEL` `text` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-LEVEL)

    `ROW` or `STATEMENT`, depending on the trigger's definition.

* `TG_OP` `text` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-OP)

    operation for which the trigger was fired: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE`.

* `TG_RELID` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class.html "53.11. pg_class").`oid`) [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-RELID)

    object ID of the table that caused the trigger invocation.

* `TG_RELNAME` `name` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-RELNAME)

    table that caused the trigger invocation. This is now deprecated, and could disappear in a future release. Use `TG_TABLE_NAME` instead.

* `TG_TABLE_NAME` `name` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-TABLE-NAME)

    table that caused the trigger invocation.

* `TG_TABLE_SCHEMA` `name` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-TABLE-SCHEMA)

    schema of the table that caused the trigger invocation.

* `TG_NARGS` `integer` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-NARGS)

    number of arguments given to the trigger function in the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement.

* `TG_ARGV` `text[]` [#](#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER-TG-ARGV)

    arguments from the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement. The index counts from 0. Invalid indexes (less than 0 or greater than or equal to `tg_nargs`) result in a null value.

A trigger function must return either `NULL` or a record/row value having exactly the structure of the table the trigger was fired for.

Row-level triggers fired `BEFORE` can return null to signal the trigger manager to skip the rest of the operation for this row (i.e., subsequent triggers are not fired, and the `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` does not occur for this row). If a nonnull value is returned then the operation proceeds with that row value. Returning a row value different from the original value of `NEW` alters the row that will be inserted or updated. Thus, if the trigger function wants the triggering action to succeed normally without altering the row value, `NEW` (or a value equal thereto) has to be returned. To alter the row to be stored, it is possible to replace single values directly in `NEW` and return the modified `NEW`, or to build a complete new record/row to return. In the case of a before-trigger on `DELETE`, the returned value has no direct effect, but it has to be nonnull to allow the trigger action to proceed. Note that `NEW` is null in `DELETE` triggers, so returning that is usually not sensible. The usual idiom in `DELETE` triggers is to return `OLD`.

`INSTEAD OF` triggers (which are always row-level triggers, and may only be used on views) can return null to signal that they did not perform any updates, and that the rest of the operation for this row should be skipped (i.e., subsequent triggers are not fired, and the row is not counted in the rows-affected status for the surrounding `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`). Otherwise a nonnull value should be returned, to signal that the trigger performed the requested operation. For `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations, the return value should be `NEW`, which the trigger function may modify to support `INSERT RETURNING` and `UPDATE RETURNING` (this will also affect the row value passed to any subsequent triggers, or passed to a special `EXCLUDED` alias reference within an `INSERT` statement with an `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` clause). For `DELETE` operations, the return value should be `OLD`.

The return value of a row-level trigger fired `AFTER` or a statement-level trigger fired `BEFORE` or `AFTER` is always ignored; it might as well be null. However, any of these types of triggers might still abort the entire operation by raising an error.

[Example 43.3](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-TRIGGER-EXAMPLE "Example 43.3. A PL/pgSQL Trigger Function") shows an example of a trigger function in PL/pgSQL.

**Example 43.3. A PL/pgSQL Trigger Function**

This example trigger ensures that any time a row is inserted or updated in the table, the current user name and time are stamped into the row. And it checks that an employee's name is given and that the salary is a positive value.

```

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empname           text,
    salary            integer,
    last_date         timestamp,
    last_user         text
);

CREATE FUNCTION emp_stamp() RETURNS trigger AS $emp_stamp$
    BEGIN
        -- Check that empname and salary are given
        IF NEW.empname IS NULL THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'empname cannot be null';
        END IF;
        IF NEW.salary IS NULL THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION '% cannot have null salary', NEW.empname;
        END IF;

        -- Who works for us when they must pay for it?
        IF NEW.salary < 0 THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION '% cannot have a negative salary', NEW.empname;
        END IF;

        -- Remember who changed the payroll when
        NEW.last_date := current_timestamp;
        NEW.last_user := current_user;
        RETURN NEW;
    END;
$emp_stamp$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER emp_stamp BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON emp
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION emp_stamp();
```

\

Another way to log changes to a table involves creating a new table that holds a row for each insert, update, or delete that occurs. This approach can be thought of as auditing changes to a table. [Example 43.4](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-TRIGGER-AUDIT-EXAMPLE "Example 43.4. A PL/pgSQL Trigger Function for Auditing") shows an example of an audit trigger function in PL/pgSQL.

**Example 43.4. A PL/pgSQL Trigger Function for Auditing**

This example trigger ensures that any insert, update or delete of a row in the `emp` table is recorded (i.e., audited) in the `emp_audit` table. The current time and user name are stamped into the row, together with the type of operation performed on it.

```

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empname           text NOT NULL,
    salary            integer
);

CREATE TABLE emp_audit(
    operation         char(1)   NOT NULL,
    stamp             timestamp NOT NULL,
    userid            text      NOT NULL,
    empname           text      NOT NULL,
    salary            integer
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_emp_audit() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $emp_audit$
    BEGIN
        --
        -- Create a row in emp_audit to reflect the operation performed on emp,
        -- making use of the special variable TG_OP to work out the operation.
        --
        IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
            INSERT INTO emp_audit SELECT 'D', now(), current_user, OLD.*;
        ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
            INSERT INTO emp_audit SELECT 'U', now(), current_user, NEW.*;
        ELSIF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
            INSERT INTO emp_audit SELECT 'I', now(), current_user, NEW.*;
        END IF;
        RETURN NULL; -- result is ignored since this is an AFTER trigger
    END;
$emp_audit$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER emp_audit
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION process_emp_audit();
```

\

A variation of the previous example uses a view joining the main table to the audit table, to show when each entry was last modified. This approach still records the full audit trail of changes to the table, but also presents a simplified view of the audit trail, showing just the last modified timestamp derived from the audit trail for each entry. [Example 43.5](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-VIEW-TRIGGER-AUDIT-EXAMPLE "Example 43.5. A PL/pgSQL View Trigger Function for Auditing") shows an example of an audit trigger on a view in PL/pgSQL.

**Example 43.5. A PL/pgSQL View Trigger Function for Auditing**

This example uses a trigger on the view to make it updatable, and ensure that any insert, update or delete of a row in the view is recorded (i.e., audited) in the `emp_audit` table. The current time and user name are recorded, together with the type of operation performed, and the view displays the last modified time of each row.

```

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empname           text PRIMARY KEY,
    salary            integer
);

CREATE TABLE emp_audit(
    operation         char(1)   NOT NULL,
    userid            text      NOT NULL,
    empname           text      NOT NULL,
    salary            integer,
    stamp             timestamp NOT NULL
);

CREATE VIEW emp_view AS
    SELECT e.empname,
           e.salary,
           max(ea.stamp) AS last_updated
      FROM emp e
      LEFT JOIN emp_audit ea ON ea.empname = e.empname
     GROUP BY 1, 2;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_emp_view() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
        --
        -- Perform the required operation on emp, and create a row in emp_audit
        -- to reflect the change made to emp.
        --
        IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
            DELETE FROM emp WHERE empname = OLD.empname;
            IF NOT FOUND THEN RETURN NULL; END IF;

            OLD.last_updated = now();
            INSERT INTO emp_audit VALUES('D', current_user, OLD.*);
            RETURN OLD;
        ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
            UPDATE emp SET salary = NEW.salary WHERE empname = OLD.empname;
            IF NOT FOUND THEN RETURN NULL; END IF;

            NEW.last_updated = now();
            INSERT INTO emp_audit VALUES('U', current_user, NEW.*);
            RETURN NEW;
        ELSIF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
            INSERT INTO emp VALUES(NEW.empname, NEW.salary);

            NEW.last_updated = now();
            INSERT INTO emp_audit VALUES('I', current_user, NEW.*);
            RETURN NEW;
        END IF;
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER emp_audit
INSTEAD OF INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp_view
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_emp_view();
```

One use of triggers is to maintain a summary table of another table. The resulting summary can be used in place of the original table for certain queries — often with vastly reduced run times. This technique is commonly used in Data Warehousing, where the tables of measured or observed data (called fact tables) might be extremely large. [Example 43.6](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-TRIGGER-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE "Example 43.6. A PL/pgSQL Trigger Function for Maintaining a Summary Table") shows an example of a trigger function in PL/pgSQL that maintains a summary table for a fact table in a data warehouse.

**Example 43.6. A PL/pgSQL Trigger Function for Maintaining a Summary Table**

The schema detailed here is partly based on the *Grocery Store*example from *The Data Warehouse Toolkit* by Ralph Kimball.

`AFTER` triggers can also make use of *transition tables* to inspect the entire set of rows changed by the triggering statement. The `CREATE TRIGGER` command assigns names to one or both transition tables, and then the function can refer to those names as though they were read-only temporary tables. [Example 43.7](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-TRIGGER-AUDIT-TRANSITION-EXAMPLE "Example 43.7. Auditing with Transition Tables") shows an example.

**Example 43.7. Auditing with Transition Tables**

This example produces the same results as [Example 43.4](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-TRIGGER-AUDIT-EXAMPLE "Example 43.4. A PL/pgSQL Trigger Function for Auditing"), but instead of using a trigger that fires for every row, it uses a trigger that fires once per statement, after collecting the relevant information in a transition table. This can be significantly faster than the row-trigger approach when the invoking statement has modified many rows. Notice that we must make a separate trigger declaration for each kind of event, since the `REFERENCING` clauses must be different for each case. But this does not stop us from using a single trigger function if we choose. (In practice, it might be better to use three separate functions and avoid the run-time tests on `TG_OP`.)

### 43.10.2. Triggers on Events [#](#PLPGSQL-EVENT-TRIGGER)

PL/pgSQL can be used to define [event triggers](event-triggers.html "Chapter 40. Event Triggers"). PostgreSQL requires that a function that is to be called as an event trigger must be declared as a function with no arguments and a return type of `event_trigger`.

When a PL/pgSQL function is called as an event trigger, several special variables are created automatically in the top-level block. They are:

* `TG_EVENT` `text` [#](#PLPGSQL-EVENT-TRIGGER-TG-EVENT)

    event the trigger is fired for.

* `TG_TAG` `text` [#](#PLPGSQL-EVENT-TRIGGER-TG-TAG)

    command tag for which the trigger is fired.

[Example 43.8](plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-EVENT-TRIGGER-EXAMPLE "Example 43.8. A PL/pgSQL Event Trigger Function") shows an example of an event trigger function in PL/pgSQL.

**Example 43.8. A PL/pgSQL Event Trigger Function**

This example trigger simply raises a `NOTICE` message each time a supported command is executed.

```

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION snitch() RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'snitch: % %', tg_event, tg_tag;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER snitch ON ddl_command_start EXECUTE FUNCTION snitch();
```
