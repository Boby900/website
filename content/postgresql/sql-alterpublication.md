## ALTER PUBLICATION

ALTER PUBLICATION â€” change the definition of a publication

## Synopsis

```

ALTER PUBLICATION name ADD publication_object [, ...]
ALTER PUBLICATION name SET publication_object [, ...]
ALTER PUBLICATION name DROP publication_object [, ...]
ALTER PUBLICATION name SET ( publication_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )
ALTER PUBLICATION name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER PUBLICATION name RENAME TO new_name

where publication_object is one of:

    TABLE [ ONLY ] table_name [ * ] [ ( column_name [, ... ] ) ] [ WHERE ( expression ) ] [, ... ]
    TABLES IN SCHEMA { schema_name | CURRENT_SCHEMA } [, ... ]
```

## Description

The command `ALTER PUBLICATION` can change the attributes of a publication.

The first three variants change which tables/schemas are part of the publication. The `SET` clause will replace the list of tables/schemas in the publication with the specified list; the existing tables/schemas that were present in the publication will be removed. The `ADD` and `DROP` clauses will add and remove one or more tables/schemas from the publication. Note that adding tables/schemas to a publication that is already subscribed to will require an [`ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION`](sql-altersubscription.html#SQL-ALTERSUBSCRIPTION-PARAMS-REFRESH-PUBLICATION) action on the subscribing side in order to become effective. Note also that `DROP TABLES IN SCHEMA` will not drop any schema tables that were specified using [`FOR TABLE`](sql-createpublication.html#SQL-CREATEPUBLICATION-FOR-TABLE)/ `ADD TABLE`, and the combination of `DROP` with a `WHERE` clause is not allowed.

The fourth variant of this command listed in the synopsis can change all of the publication properties specified in [CREATE PUBLICATION](sql-createpublication.html "CREATE PUBLICATION"). Properties not mentioned in the command retain their previous settings.

The remaining variants change the owner and the name of the publication.

You must own the publication to use `ALTER PUBLICATION`. Adding a table to a publication additionally requires owning that table. The `ADD TABLES IN SCHEMA` and `SET TABLES IN SCHEMA` to a publication requires the invoking user to be a superuser. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the database. Also, the new owner of a [`FOR ALL TABLES`](sql-createpublication.html#SQL-CREATEPUBLICATION-FOR-ALL-TABLES) or [`FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA`](sql-createpublication.html#SQL-CREATEPUBLICATION-FOR-TABLES-IN-SCHEMA) publication must be a superuser. However, a superuser can change the ownership of a publication regardless of these restrictions.

Adding/Setting any schema when the publication also publishes a table with a column list, and vice versa is not supported.

## Parameters

* *`name`*

    The name of an existing publication whose definition is to be altered.

* *`table_name`*

    Name of an existing table. If `ONLY` is specified before the table name, only that table is affected. If `ONLY` is not specified, the table and all its descendant tables (if any) are affected. Optionally, `*` can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included.

    Optionally, a column list can be specified. See [CREATE PUBLICATION](sql-createpublication.html "CREATE PUBLICATION") for details. Note that a subscription having several publications in which the same table has been published with different column lists is not supported. See [Warning: Combining Column Lists from Multiple Publications](logical-replication-col-lists.html#LOGICAL-REPLICATION-COL-LIST-COMBINING "Warning: Combining Column Lists from Multiple Publications") for details of potential problems when altering column lists.

    If the optional `WHERE` clause is specified, rows for which the *`expression`* evaluates to false or null will not be published. Note that parentheses are required around the expression. The *`expression`* is evaluated with the role used for the replication connection.

* *`schema_name`*

    Name of an existing schema.

* `SET ( publication_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )`

    This clause alters publication parameters originally set by [CREATE PUBLICATION](sql-createpublication.html "CREATE PUBLICATION"). See there for more information.

* *`new_owner`*

    The user name of the new owner of the publication.

* *`new_name`*

    The new name for the publication.

## Examples

Change the publication to publish only deletes and updates:

```

ALTER PUBLICATION noinsert SET (publish = 'update, delete');
```

Add some tables to the publication:

```

ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication ADD TABLE users (user_id, firstname), departments;
```

Change the set of columns published for a table:

```

ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication SET TABLE users (user_id, firstname, lastname), TABLE departments;
```

Add schemas `marketing` and `sales` to the publication `sales_publication`:

```

ALTER PUBLICATION sales_publication ADD TABLES IN SCHEMA marketing, sales;
```

Add tables `users`, `departments` and schema `production` to the publication `production_publication`:

```

ALTER PUBLICATION production_publication ADD TABLE users, departments, TABLES IN SCHEMA production;
```

## Compatibility
