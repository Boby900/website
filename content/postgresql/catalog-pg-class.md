## 53.11. `pg_class` [#](#CATALOG-PG-CLASS)

The catalog `pg_class` describes tables and other objects that have columns or are otherwise similar to a table. This includes indexes (but see also [`pg_index`](catalog-pg-index.html "53.26. pg_index")), sequences (but see also [`pg_sequence`](catalog-pg-sequence.html "53.47. pg_sequence")), views, materialized views, composite types, and TOAST tables; see `relkind`. Below, when we mean all of these kinds of objects we speak of “relations”. Not all of `pg_class`'s columns are meaningful for all relation kinds.

It is updated by [`VACUUM`](sql-vacuum.html "VACUUM"), [`ANALYZE`](sql-analyze.html "ANALYZE"), and a few DDL commands such as [`CREATE INDEX`](sql-createindex.html "CREATE INDEX"). If the table has never yet been vacuumed or analyzed, `reltuples` contains `-1` indicating that the row count is unknown. |
| `relallvisible` `int4`Number of pages that are marked all-visible in the table's visibility map. This is only an estimate used by the planner. It is updated by [`VACUUM`](sql-vacuum.html "VACUUM"), [`ANALYZE`](sql-analyze.html "ANALYZE"), and a few DDL commands such as [`CREATE INDEX`](sql-createindex.html "CREATE INDEX").                                                                                |
| `reltoastrelid` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class.html "53.11. pg_class").`oid`)OID of the TOAST table associated with this table, zero if none.

Several of the Boolean flags in `pg_class` are maintained lazily: they are guaranteed to be true if that's the correct state, but may not be reset to false immediately when the condition is no longer true. For example, `relhasindex` is set by [`CREATE INDEX`](sql-createindex.html "CREATE INDEX"), but it is never cleared by [`DROP INDEX`](sql-dropindex.html "DROP INDEX"). Instead, [`VACUUM`](sql-vacuum.html "VACUUM") clears `relhasindex` if it finds the table has no indexes. This arrangement avoids race conditions and improves concurrency.
