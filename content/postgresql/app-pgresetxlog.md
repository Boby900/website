## P.4. `pg_resetxlog` renamed to `pg_resetwal` [#](#APP-PGRESETXLOG)

PostgreSQL 9.6 and below provided a command named `pg_resetxlog` to reset the write-ahead-log (WAL) files. This command was renamed to `pg_resetwal`, see [pg\_resetwal](app-pgresetwal.html "pg_resetwal") for documentation of `pg_resetwal` and see [the release notes for PostgreSQL 10](release-prior.html "E.2. Prior Releases") for details on this change.
