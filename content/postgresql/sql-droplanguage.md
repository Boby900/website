## DROP LANGUAGE

DROP LANGUAGE — remove a procedural language

## Synopsis

```

DROP [ PROCEDURAL ] LANGUAGE [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP LANGUAGE` removes the definition of a previously registered procedural language. You must be a superuser or the owner of the language to use `DROP LANGUAGE`.

### Note

As of PostgreSQL 9.1, most procedural languages have been made into “extensions”, and should therefore be removed with [`DROP EXTENSION`](sql-dropextension.html "DROP EXTENSION") not `DROP LANGUAGE`.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the language does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name of an existing procedural language.

* `CASCADE`

    Automatically drop objects that depend on the language (such as functions in the language), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.14](ddl-depend.html "5.14. Dependency Tracking")).

* `RESTRICT`

    Refuse to drop the language if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

This command removes the procedural language `plsample`:

```

DROP LANGUAGE plsample;
```

## Compatibility

There is no `DROP LANGUAGE` statement in the SQL standard.
