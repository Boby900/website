## 54.34. `pg_user_mappings` [#](#VIEW-PG-USER-MAPPINGS)

The view `pg_user_mappings` provides access to information about user mappings. This is essentially a publicly readable view of [`pg_user_mapping`](catalog-pg-user-mapping.html "53.65. pg_user_mapping") that leaves out the options field if the user has no rights to use it.

To protect password information stored as a user mapping option, the `umoptions` column will read as null unless one of the following applies:

* current user is the user being mapped, and owns the server or holds `USAGE` privilege on it
* current user is the server owner and mapping is for `PUBLIC`
* current user is a superuser
