## SPI\_start\_transaction

SPI\_start\_transaction â€” obsolete function

## Synopsis

```

void SPI_start_transaction(void)
```

## Description

`SPI_start_transaction` does nothing, and exists only for code compatibility with earlier PostgreSQL releases. It used to be required after calling `SPI_commit` or `SPI_rollback`, but now those functions start a new transaction automatically.
