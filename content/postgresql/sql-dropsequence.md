## DROP SEQUENCE

DROP SEQUENCE — remove a sequence

## Synopsis

```

DROP SEQUENCE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP SEQUENCE` removes sequence number generators. A sequence can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the sequence does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a sequence.

* `CASCADE`

    Automatically drop objects that depend on the sequence, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.14](ddl-depend.html "5.14. Dependency Tracking")).

* `RESTRICT`

    Refuse to drop the sequence if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

To remove the sequence `serial`:

```

DROP SEQUENCE serial;
```

## Compatibility

`DROP SEQUENCE` conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one sequence to be dropped per command, and apart from the `IF EXISTS` option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
