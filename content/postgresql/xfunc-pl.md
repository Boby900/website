## 38.8. Procedural Language Functions [#](#XFUNC-PL)

PostgreSQL allows user-defined functions to be written in other languages besides SQL and C. These other languages are generically called *procedural languages* (PLs). Procedural languages aren't built into the PostgreSQL server; they are offered by loadable modules. See [Chapter 42](xplang.html "Chapter 42. Procedural Languages") and following chapters for more information.
