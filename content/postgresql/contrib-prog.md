This appendix and the previous one contain information regarding the modules that can be found in the `contrib` directory of the PostgreSQL distribution. See [Appendix F](contrib.html "Appendix F. Additional Supplied Modules and Extensions") for more information about the `contrib` section in general and server extensions and plug-ins found in `contrib` specifically.
