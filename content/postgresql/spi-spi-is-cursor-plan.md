## SPI\_is\_cursor\_plan

SPI\_is\_cursor\_plan â€” return `true` if a statement prepared by `SPI_prepare` can be used with `SPI_cursor_open`

## Synopsis

```

bool SPI_is_cursor_plan(SPIPlanPtr plan)
```

## Description

`SPI_is_cursor_plan` returns `true` if a statement prepared by `SPI_prepare` can be passed as an argument to `SPI_cursor_open`, or `false` if that is not the case. The criteria are that the *`plan`* represents one single command and that this command returns tuples to the caller; for example, `SELECT` is allowed unless it contains an `INTO` clause, and `UPDATE` is allowed only if it contains a `RETURNING` clause.

## Arguments

* `SPIPlanPtr plan`

    prepared statement (returned by `SPI_prepare`)

## Return Value

`true` or `false` to indicate if the *`plan`* can produce a cursor or not, with `SPI_result` set to zero. If it is not possible to determine the answer (for example, if the *`plan`* is `NULL` or invalid, or if called when not connected to SPI), then `SPI_result` is set to a suitable error code and `false` is returned.
