## DROP CONVERSION

DROP CONVERSION â€” remove a conversion

## Synopsis

```

DROP CONVERSION [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP CONVERSION` removes a previously defined conversion. To be able to drop a conversion, you must own the conversion.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the conversion does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name of the conversion. The conversion name can be schema-qualified.

* `CASCADE``RESTRICT`

    These key words do not have any effect, since there are no dependencies on conversions.

## Examples

To drop the conversion named `myname`:

```

DROP CONVERSION myname;
```

## Compatibility

There is no `DROP CONVERSION` statement in the SQL standard, but a `DROP TRANSLATION` statement that goes along with the `CREATE TRANSLATION` statement that is similar to the `CREATE CONVERSION` statement in PostgreSQL.
