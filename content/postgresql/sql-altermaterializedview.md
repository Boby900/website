## Description

`ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` changes various auxiliary properties of an existing materialized view.

You must own the materialized view to use `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW`. To change a materialized view's schema, you must also have `CREATE` privilege on the new schema. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the materialized view's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the materialized view. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any view anyway.)

The statement subforms and actions available for `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` are a subset of those available for `ALTER TABLE`, and have the same meaning when used for materialized views. See the descriptions for [`ALTER TABLE`](sql-altertable.html "ALTER TABLE") for details.

## Parameters

* *`name`*

    The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing materialized view.

* *`column_name`*

    Name of a new or existing column.

* *`extension_name`*

    The name of the extension that the materialized view is to depend on (or no longer dependent on, if `NO` is specified). A materialized view that's marked as dependent on an extension is automatically dropped when the extension is dropped.

* *`new_column_name`*

    New name for an existing column.

* *`new_owner`*

    The user name of the new owner of the materialized view.

* *`new_name`*

    The new name for the materialized view.

* *`new_schema`*

    The new schema for the materialized view.

## Examples

To rename the materialized view `foo` to `bar`:

```

ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW foo RENAME TO bar;
```

## Compatibility

`ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` is a PostgreSQL extension.
