## ALTER EVENT TRIGGER

ALTER EVENT TRIGGER â€” change the definition of an event trigger

## Synopsis

ALTER EVENT TRIGGER name DISABLE
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER name ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ]
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER name RENAME TO new_name
```

## Description

`ALTER EVENT TRIGGER` changes properties of an existing event trigger.

You must be superuser to alter an event trigger.

## Parameters

* *`name`*

    The name of an existing trigger to alter.

* *`new_owner`*

    The user name of the new owner of the event trigger.

* *`new_name`*

    The new name of the event trigger.
