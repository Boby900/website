## 53.5. `pg_amproc` [#](#CATALOG-PG-AMPROC)

The catalog `pg_amproc` stores information about support functions associated with access method operator families. There is one row for each support function belonging to an operator family.

The usual interpretation of the `amproclefttype` and `amprocrighttype` fields is that they identify the left and right input types of the operator(s) that a particular support function supports. For some access methods these match the input data type(s) of the support function itself, for others not. There is a notion of “default” support functions for an index, which are those with `amproclefttype` and `amprocrighttype` both equal to the index operator class's `opcintype`.
