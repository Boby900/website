## SPI\_connect

SPI\_connect, SPI\_connect\_ext â€” connect a C function to the SPI manager

## Synopsis

```

int SPI_connect(void)
```

```

int SPI_connect_ext(int options)
```

## Description

`SPI_connect` opens a connection from a C function invocation to the SPI manager. You must call this function if you want to execute commands through SPI. Some utility SPI functions can be called from unconnected C functions.

`SPI_connect_ext` does the same but has an argument that allows passing option flags. Currently, the following option values are available:

* `SPI_OPT_NONATOMIC`

    Sets the SPI connection to be *nonatomic*, which means that transaction control calls (`SPI_commit`, `SPI_rollback`) are allowed. Otherwise, calling those functions will result in an immediate error.

`SPI_connect()` is equivalent to `SPI_connect_ext(0)`.

## Return Value

* `SPI_OK_CONNECT`

    on success

* `SPI_ERROR_CONNECT`

    on error
