## ALTER PROCEDURE

ALTER PROCEDURE — change the definition of a procedure

## Synopsis

```

ALTER PROCEDURE name [ ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [, ...] ] ) ]
    action [ ... ] [ RESTRICT ]
ALTER PROCEDURE name [ ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [, ...] ] ) ]
    RENAME TO new_name
ALTER PROCEDURE name [ ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [, ...] ] ) ]
    OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER PROCEDURE name [ ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [, ...] ] ) ]
    SET SCHEMA new_schema
ALTER PROCEDURE name [ ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [, ...] ] ) ]
    [ NO ] DEPENDS ON EXTENSION extension_name

where action is one of:

    [ EXTERNAL ] SECURITY INVOKER | [ EXTERNAL ] SECURITY DEFINER
    SET configuration_parameter { TO | = } { value | DEFAULT }
    SET configuration_parameter FROM CURRENT
    RESET configuration_parameter
    RESET ALL
```

## Description

`ALTER PROCEDURE` changes the definition of a procedure.

You must own the procedure to use `ALTER PROCEDURE`. To change a procedure's schema, you must also have `CREATE` privilege on the new schema. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the procedure's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the procedure. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any procedure anyway.)

## Parameters

* *`name`*

    The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing procedure. If no argument list is specified, the name must be unique in its schema.

* *`argmode`*

    The mode of an argument: `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`.

* *`argname`*

    The name of an argument. Note that `ALTER PROCEDURE` does not actually pay any attention to argument names, since only the argument data types are used to determine the procedure's identity.

* *`argtype`*

    The data type(s) of the procedure's arguments (optionally schema-qualified), if any. See [DROP PROCEDURE](sql-dropprocedure.html "DROP PROCEDURE") for the details of how the procedure is looked up using the argument data type(s).

* *`new_name`*

    The new name of the procedure.

* *`new_owner`*

    The new owner of the procedure. Note that if the procedure is marked `SECURITY DEFINER`, it will subsequently execute as the new owner.

* *`new_schema`*

    The new schema for the procedure.

* *`extension_name`*

    This form marks the procedure as dependent on the extension, or no longer dependent on the extension if `NO` is specified. A procedure that's marked as dependent on an extension is dropped when the extension is dropped, even if cascade is not specified. A procedure can depend upon multiple extensions, and will be dropped when any one of those extensions is dropped.

* `[ EXTERNAL ] SECURITY INVOKER``[ EXTERNAL ] SECURITY DEFINER`

    Change whether the procedure is a security definer or not. The key word `EXTERNAL` is ignored for SQL conformance. See [CREATE PROCEDURE](sql-createprocedure.html "CREATE PROCEDURE") for more information about this capability.

* *`configuration_parameter`**`value`*

    Add or change the assignment to be made to a configuration parameter when the procedure is called. If *`value`* is `DEFAULT` or, equivalently, `RESET` is used, the procedure-local setting is removed, so that the procedure executes with the value present in its environment. Use `RESET ALL` to clear all procedure-local settings. `SET FROM CURRENT` saves the value of the parameter that is current when `ALTER PROCEDURE` is executed as the value to be applied when the procedure is entered.

    See [SET](sql-set.html "SET") and [Chapter 20](runtime-config.html "Chapter 20. Server Configuration") for more information about allowed parameter names and values.

* `RESTRICT`

    Ignored for conformance with the SQL standard.

## Examples

To rename the procedure `insert_data` with two arguments of type `integer` to `insert_record`:

```

ALTER PROCEDURE insert_data(integer, integer) RENAME TO insert_record;
```

To change the owner of the procedure `insert_data` with two arguments of type `integer` to `joe`:

```

ALTER PROCEDURE insert_data(integer, integer) OWNER TO joe;
```

To change the schema of the procedure `insert_data` with two arguments of type `integer` to `accounting`:

```

ALTER PROCEDURE insert_data(integer, integer) SET SCHEMA accounting;
```

To mark the procedure `insert_data(integer, integer)` as being dependent on the extension `myext`:

```

ALTER PROCEDURE insert_data(integer, integer) DEPENDS ON EXTENSION myext;
```

To adjust the search path that is automatically set for a procedure:

```

ALTER PROCEDURE check_password(text) SET search_path = admin, pg_temp;
```

To disable automatic setting of `search_path` for a procedure:

```

ALTER PROCEDURE check_password(text) RESET search_path;
```

The procedure will now execute with whatever search path is used by its caller.

## Compatibility

This statement is partially compatible with the `ALTER PROCEDURE` statement in the SQL standard. The standard allows more properties of a procedure to be modified, but does not provide the ability to rename a procedure, make a procedure a security definer, attach configuration parameter values to a procedure, or change the owner, schema, or volatility of a procedure. The standard also requires the `RESTRICT` key word, which is optional in PostgreSQL.
