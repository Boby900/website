## DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW

DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW — remove a materialized view

## Synopsis

```

DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` drops an existing materialized view. To execute this command you must be the owner of the materialized view.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the materialized view does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the materialized view to remove.

* `CASCADE`

    Automatically drop objects that depend on the materialized view (such as other materialized views, or regular views), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.14](ddl-depend.html "5.14. Dependency Tracking")).

* `RESTRICT`

    Refuse to drop the materialized view if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

This command will remove the materialized view called `order_summary`:

```

DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW order_summary;
```
