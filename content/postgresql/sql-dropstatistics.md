## DROP STATISTICS

DROP STATISTICS â€” remove extended statistics

## Synopsis

```

DROP STATISTICS [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP STATISTICS` removes statistics object(s) from the database. Only the statistics object's owner, the schema owner, or a superuser can drop a statistics object.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the statistics object does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the statistics object to drop.

* `CASCADE``RESTRICT`

    These key words do not have any effect, since there are no dependencies on statistics.

## Examples

To destroy two statistics objects in different schemas, without failing if they don't exist:

```

DROP STATISTICS IF EXISTS
    accounting.users_uid_creation,
    public.grants_user_role;
```

## Compatibility

There is no `DROP STATISTICS` command in the SQL standard.
