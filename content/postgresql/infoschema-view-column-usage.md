## 37.63. `view_column_usage` [#](#INFOSCHEMA-VIEW-COLUMN-USAGE)

The view `view_column_usage` identifies all columns that are used in the query expression of a view (the `SELECT` statement that defines the view). A column is only included if the table that contains the column is owned by a currently enabled role.

### Note

Columns of system tables are not included. This should be fixed sometime.
