\

A `pg_default_acl` entry shows the initial privileges to be assigned to an object belonging to the indicated user. There are currently two types of entry: “global” entries with `defaclnamespace` = zero, and “per-schema” entries that reference a particular schema. If a global entry is present then it *overrides* the normal hard-wired default privileges for the object type. A per-schema entry, if present, represents privileges to be *added to* the global or hard-wired default privileges.

Note that when an ACL entry in another catalog is null, it is taken to represent the hard-wired default privileges for its object, *not* whatever might be in `pg_default_acl` at the moment. `pg_default_acl` is only consulted during object creation.
