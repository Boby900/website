## 55.9. Logical Replication Message Formats [#](#PROTOCOL-LOGICALREP-MESSAGE-FORMATS)

This section describes the detailed format of each logical replication message. These messages are either returned by the replication slot SQL interface or are sent by a walsender. In the case of a walsender, they are encapsulated inside replication protocol WAL messages as described in [Section 55.4](protocol-replication.html "55.4. Streaming Replication Protocol"), and generally obey the same message flow as physical replication.
