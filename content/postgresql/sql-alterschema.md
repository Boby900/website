## ALTER SCHEMA

ALTER SCHEMA â€” change the definition of a schema

## Synopsis

```

ALTER SCHEMA name RENAME TO new_name
ALTER SCHEMA name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
```

## Description

`ALTER SCHEMA` changes the definition of a schema.

You must own the schema to use `ALTER SCHEMA`. To rename a schema you must also have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. (Note that superusers have all these privileges automatically.)

## Parameters

* *`name`*

    The name of an existing schema.

* *`new_name`*

    The new name of the schema. The new name cannot begin with `pg_`, as such names are reserved for system schemas.

* *`new_owner`*

    The new owner of the schema.

## Compatibility

There is no `ALTER SCHEMA` statement in the SQL standard.
