## 74.4. Two-Phase Transactions [#](#TWO-PHASE)

PostgreSQL supports a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol that allows multiple distributed systems to work together in a transactional manner. The commands are `PREPARE TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT PREPARED` and `ROLLBACK PREPARED`. Two-phase transactions are intended for use by external transaction management systems. PostgreSQL follows the features and model proposed by the X/Open XA standard, but does not implement some less often used aspects.

When the user executes `PREPARE TRANSACTION`, the only possible next commands are `COMMIT PREPARED` or `ROLLBACK PREPARED`. In general, this prepared state is intended to be of very short duration, but external availability issues might mean transactions stay in this state for an extended interval. Short-lived prepared transactions are stored only in shared memory and WAL. Transactions that span checkpoints are recorded in the `pg_twophase` directory. Transactions that are currently prepared can be inspected using [`pg_prepared_xacts`](view-pg-prepared-xacts.html "54.16. pg_prepared_xacts").
