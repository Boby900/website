## 53.8. `pg_authid` [#](#CATALOG-PG-AUTHID)

The catalog `pg_authid` contains information about database authorization identifiers (roles). A role subsumes the concepts of “users” and “groups”. A user is essentially just a role with the `rolcanlogin` flag set. Any role (with or without `rolcanlogin`) can have other roles as members; see [`pg_auth_members`](catalog-pg-auth-members.html "53.9. pg_auth_members").

Since this catalog contains passwords, it must not be publicly readable. [`pg_roles`](view-pg-roles.html "54.20. pg_roles") is a publicly readable view on `pg_authid` that blanks out the password field.

[Chapter 22](user-manag.html "Chapter 22. Database Roles") contains detailed information about user and privilege management.

Because user identities are cluster-wide, `pg_authid` is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of `pg_authid` per cluster, not one per database.

| `rolinherit` `bool`Role automatically inherits privileges of roles it is a member of                                                                           |
| `rolcreaterole` `bool`Role can create more roles                                                                                                               |

| `rolcanlogin` `bool`Role can log in. That is, this role can be given as the initial session authorization identifier.                                          |
| `rolreplication` `bool`Role is a replication role. A replication role can initiate replication connections and create and drop replication slots.              |
| `rolbypassrls` `bool`Role bypasses every row-level security policy, see [Section 5.8](ddl-rowsecurity.html "5.8. Row Security Policies") for more information. |
| `rolconnlimit` `int4`For roles that can log in, this sets maximum number of concurrent connections this role can make. -1 means no limit.                      |
| `rolpassword` `text`Password (possibly encrypted); null if none. The format depends on the form of encryption used.                                            |
| `rolvaliduntil` `timestamptz`Password expiry time (only used for password authentication); null if no expiration                                               |

For an MD5 encrypted password, `rolpassword` column will begin with the string `md5` followed by a 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash. The MD5 hash will be of the user's password concatenated to their user name. For example, if user `joe` has password `xyzzy`, PostgreSQL will store the md5 hash of `xyzzyjoe`.

If the password is encrypted with SCRAM-SHA-256, it has the format:

```

SCRAM-SHA-256$<iteration count>:<salt>$<StoredKey>:<ServerKey>
```

where *`salt`*, *`StoredKey`* and *`ServerKey`* are in Base64 encoded format. This format is the same as that specified by [RFC 5803](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5803).

A password that does not follow either of those formats is assumed to be unencrypted.
