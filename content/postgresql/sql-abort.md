## ABORT

ABORT â€” abort the current transaction

## Synopsis

```

ABORT [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]
```

## Description

`ABORT` rolls back the current transaction and causes all the updates made by the transaction to be discarded. This command is identical in behavior to the standard SQL command [`ROLLBACK`](sql-rollback.html "ROLLBACK"), and is present only for historical reasons.

## Parameters

* `WORK``TRANSACTION`

    Optional key words. They have no effect.

* `AND CHAIN`

    If `AND CHAIN` is specified, a new transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see [`SET TRANSACTION`](sql-set-transaction.html "SET TRANSACTION")) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.

## Notes

Use [`COMMIT`](sql-commit.html "COMMIT") to successfully terminate a transaction.

Issuing `ABORT` outside of a transaction block emits a warning and otherwise has no effect.

## Examples

To abort all changes:

```

ABORT;
```

## Compatibility

This command is a PostgreSQL extension present for historical reasons. `ROLLBACK` is the equivalent standard SQL command.
