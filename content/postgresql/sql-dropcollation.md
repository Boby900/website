## DROP COLLATION

DROP COLLATION — remove a collation

## Synopsis

```

DROP COLLATION [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP COLLATION` removes a previously defined collation. To be able to drop a collation, you must own the collation.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the collation does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name of the collation. The collation name can be schema-qualified.

* `CASCADE`

    Automatically drop objects that depend on the collation, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.14](ddl-depend.html "5.14. Dependency Tracking")).

* `RESTRICT`

    Refuse to drop the collation if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

To drop the collation named `german`:

```

DROP COLLATION german;
```

## Compatibility

The `DROP COLLATION` command conforms to the SQL standard, apart from the `IF EXISTS` option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
