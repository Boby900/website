The `pg_buffercache` module provides a means for examining what's happening in the shared buffer cache in real time.

This module provides the `pg_buffercache_pages()` function (wrapped in the `pg_buffercache` view), the `pg_buffercache_summary()` function, and the `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` function.

The `pg_buffercache_pages()` function returns a set of records, each row describing the state of one shared buffer entry. The `pg_buffercache` view wraps the function for convenient use.

The `pg_buffercache_summary()` function returns a single row summarizing the state of the shared buffer cache.

The `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` function returns a set of records, each row describing the number of buffers with a given usage count.

By default, use is restricted to superusers and roles with privileges of the `pg_monitor` role. Access may be granted to others using `GRANT`.

### F.26.1. The `pg_buffercache` View [#](#PGBUFFERCACHE-PG-BUFFERCACHE)

The definitions of the columns exposed by the view are shown in [Table F.15](pgbuffercache.html#PGBUFFERCACHE-COLUMNS "Table F.15. pg_buffercache Columns").

**Table F.15. `pg_buffercache` Columns**

| Column TypeDescription                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bufferid` `integer`ID, in the range 1..`shared_buffers`                                                                                    |

| `relblocknumber` `bigint`Page number within the relation                                                                                    |

| `pinning_backends` `integer`Number of backends pinning this buffer                                                                          |

There is one row for each buffer in the shared cache. Unused buffers are shown with all fields null except `bufferid`. Shared system catalogs are shown as belonging to database zero.

Because the cache is shared by all the databases, there will normally be pages from relations not belonging to the current database. This means that there may not be matching join rows in `pg_class` for some rows, or that there could even be incorrect joins. If you are trying to join against `pg_class`, it's a good idea to restrict the join to rows having `reldatabase` equal to the current database's OID or zero.

Since buffer manager locks are not taken to copy the buffer state data that the view will display, accessing `pg_buffercache` view has less impact on normal buffer activity but it doesn't provide a consistent set of results across all buffers. However, we ensure that the information of each buffer is self-consistent.

### F.26.2. The `pg_buffercache_summary()` Function [#](#PGBUFFERCACHE-SUMMARY)

The definitions of the columns exposed by the function are shown in [Table F.16](pgbuffercache.html#PGBUFFERCACHE-SUMMARY-COLUMNS "Table F.16. pg_buffercache_summary() Output Columns").

**Table F.16. `pg_buffercache_summary()` Output Columns**

| Column TypeDescription                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `buffers_used` `int4`Number of used shared buffers                  |
| `buffers_unused` `int4`Number of unused shared buffers              |
| `buffers_dirty` `int4`Number of dirty shared buffers                |
| `buffers_pinned` `int4`Number of pinned shared buffers              |
| `usagecount_avg` `float8`Average usage count of used shared buffers |

\

The `pg_buffercache_summary()` function returns a single row summarizing the state of all shared buffers. Similar and more detailed information is provided by the `pg_buffercache` view, but `pg_buffercache_summary()` is significantly cheaper.

Like the `pg_buffercache` view, `pg_buffercache_summary()` does not acquire buffer manager locks. Therefore concurrent activity can lead to minor inaccuracies in the result.

### F.26.3. The `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` Function [#](#PGBUFFERCACHE-USAGE-COUNTS)

The definitions of the columns exposed by the function are shown in [Table F.17](pgbuffercache.html#PGBUFFERCACHE_USAGE_COUNTS-COLUMNS "Table F.17. pg_buffercache_usage_counts() Output Columns").

**Table F.17. `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` Output Columns**

| Column TypeDescription                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `usage_count` `int4`A possible buffer usage count            |
| `buffers` `int4`Number of buffers with the usage count       |
| `dirty` `int4`Number of dirty buffers with the usage count   |
| `pinned` `int4`Number of pinned buffers with the usage count |

\

The `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` function returns a set of rows summarizing the states of all shared buffers, aggregated over the possible usage count values. Similar and more detailed information is provided by the `pg_buffercache` view, but `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` is significantly cheaper.

Like the `pg_buffercache` view, `pg_buffercache_usage_counts()` does not acquire buffer manager locks. Therefore concurrent activity can lead to minor inaccuracies in the result.
