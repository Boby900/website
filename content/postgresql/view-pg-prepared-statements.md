## 54.15. `pg_prepared_statements` [#](#VIEW-PG-PREPARED-STATEMENTS)

The `pg_prepared_statements` view displays all the prepared statements that are available in the current session. See [PREPARE](sql-prepare.html "PREPARE") for more information about prepared statements.

`pg_prepared_statements` contains one row for each prepared statement. Rows are added to the view when a new prepared statement is created and removed when a prepared statement is released (for example, via the [`DEALLOCATE`](sql-deallocate.html "DEALLOCATE") command).

| Column TypeDescription                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name` `text`The identifier of the prepared statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `statement` `text`The query string submitted by the client to create this prepared statement. For prepared statements created via SQL, this is the `PREPARE` statement submitted by the client. For prepared statements created via the frontend/backend protocol, this is the text of the prepared statement itself.                             |
| `prepare_time` `timestamptz`The time at which the prepared statement was created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `parameter_types` `regtype[]`The expected parameter types for the prepared statement in the form of an array of `regtype`. The OID corresponding to an element of this array can be obtained by casting the `regtype` value to `oid`.                                                                                                             |
| `result_types` `regtype[]`The types of the columns returned by the prepared statement in the form of an array of `regtype`. The OID corresponding to an element of this array can be obtained by casting the `regtype` value to `oid`. If the prepared statement does not provide a result (e.g., a DML statement), then this field will be null. |
| `from_sql` `bool``true` if the prepared statement was created via the `PREPARE` SQL command; `false` if the statement was prepared via the frontend/backend protocol                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `generic_plans` `int8`Number of times generic plan was chosen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `custom_plans` `int8`Number of times custom plan was chosen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
