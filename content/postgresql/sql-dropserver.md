## DROP SERVER

DROP SERVER — remove a foreign server descriptor

## Synopsis

```

DROP SERVER [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP SERVER` removes an existing foreign server descriptor. To execute this command, the current user must be the owner of the server.

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

    Do not throw an error if the server does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

    The name of an existing server.

* `CASCADE`

    Automatically drop objects that depend on the server (such as user mappings), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.14](ddl-depend.html "5.14. Dependency Tracking")).

* `RESTRICT`

    Refuse to drop the server if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

Drop a server `foo` if it exists:

```

DROP SERVER IF EXISTS foo;
```

## Compatibility

`DROP SERVER` conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). The `IF EXISTS` clause is a PostgreSQL extension.
