### What's new

- Control Plane: Neon's Autoscaling feature now supports fractional (1/4 and 1/2) minimum compute sizes. Previously, the minimum compute size for Autoscaling was 1.

  Autoscaling is a [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature. For configuration instructions, see [Compute size and Autoscaling configuration](../manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).
- UI: Added a **Billing** page to the Neon Console where Free Tier users can  view [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/technical-preview-free-tier) limits and learn about the benefits of upgrading to the [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan). The **Billing** page is accessible from the sidebar in the Neon Console.

- UI: Implemented minor copy, stylistic, and functional improvements for the **Request Downgrade** modal accessed from the **Billing** page.

### Bug fixes

- API: Disabled `docker` as a compute provisioning option in the Neon [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Create endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) APIs. This option is not supported with the Neon cloud service.
