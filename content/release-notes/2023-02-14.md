### Features

- Compute: Added support for the the PostgreSQL `pgvector`, `plls` and `plcoffee` extensions. For more information about PostgreSQL extensions supported by Neon, see [PostgreSQL extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/pg-extensions/).
- Proxy: Significantly reduced network latencies for WebSocket and pooled connections by implementing caching mechanism for compute node connection information and enabling the `TCP_NODELAY` protocol option. The `TCP_NODELAY` option causes segments to be sent as soon as possible, even if there is only a small amount of data. For more information, refer to the [TCP protocol man page](https://linux.die.net/man/7/tcp).
- Pageserver: Added an experimental feature that enforces a configurable data layer eviction policy. The feature periodically checks when a data layer was last accessed and evicts it if the last-access timestamp is earlier than a defined threshold.
