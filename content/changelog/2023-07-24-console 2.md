### Autosuspend delay project defaults

Neon now provides an **Autosuspend delay** control on the project creation dialog, enabling Neon Pro plan users to define a default autosuspend setting for a project's compute endpoints. The autosuspend setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. For more information, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
