A Neon account subscribed to a paid plan can manage billing from the **Billing** page in the Neon Console. On the **Billing** page, you can:

- View charges for the current month
- Update your billing email
- Update your payment method
- View and download invoices
- Downgrade your plan

For Free Tier accounts, the **Billing** page allows users to view [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) usage limits, learn about [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) features, and estimate monthly Pro plan cost based on your current usage.

## View the billing page

To access your **Billing** page:

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select **Billing** from the sidebar.

## Update your payment method

To update your payment method:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
2. Under **Payment method**, click **Edit**.
3. Click **Select a saved payment method**.
4. From the menu, select **Update card**.
5. Update your payment method and click **Update**.

If you are unable to update your payment method, please contact [support@neon.tech](mailto:support@neon.tech).

## Add a new payment method

To add a new payment method:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
2. Under **Payment method**, click **Edit**.
3. Click **Add a new payment method**.
4. Enter your card details and click **Save Card**.

If you are unable to add a payment method, please contact [support@neon.tech](mailto:support@neon.tech).

### Missed payments

If an auto-debit payment transaction fails, Neon sends a request to update your payment method. There is a grace period for missed payments followed by a delinquency period. Late fees and payment policies are described in Neonâ€™s [Terms of Service](https://neon.tech/terms-of-service).

## Invoices

A Neon invoice includes an **Amount due** for the billing period and a cost breakdown by project and [billing metric](/docs/introduction/billing).

### Download invoices

To download an invoice:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
1. Under **Latest invoices**, locate the invoice you want to download and click the PDF download icon.

## Downgrade your plan

To downgrade from the Pro plan to the Free Tier:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
1. Click **Downgrade plan** at the bottom of the page.
1. Follow the instructions on the **Downgrade** modal, and click **Downgrade**.

Downgrading from the Pro plan transitions your account to the Neon Free Tier, which has lower usage limits that may affect the performance of your applications. To compare plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans).

You will be required to remove any projects, branches, or data that exceed [Free Tier limits](/docs/introduction/free-tier). The downgrade goes into effect within 30 minutes. You will receive your final bill at the beginning of the next billing period (the start of the month following the downgrade).

To downgrade from Enterprise or Platform Partnership plans, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales). Cancellation of these plans is handled in accordance with the Master Subscription Agreement (MSA) outlined in the customer agreement.
