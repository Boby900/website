## Join the community

All Neon users can join the [Neon Discord Server](/discord) or [Neon Discourse Community](https://community.neon.tech/) to ask questions or see what others are doing with Neon.

## Open a support ticket

[Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) and [Custom Plan](/docs/introduction/custom-plan) users can open a support ticket from the Neon console. Look for the **Support** link in the sidebar. It opens the **Create Support Ticket** modal, where you can describe your issue.

You can expect an initial response time of 2 business days, from 6am to 6pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8), Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays in the United States. For custom support solutions, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

Video chat requests and retail customer support inquiries can be submitted through a support ticket.

## Support email

If you're unable to access Neon's primary support channels (e.g., the support ticket form in the Neon Console or our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/92vNTzKDGp)), you can use the following email as a fallback:

**Email**: `support@neon.tech`

Response times might be longer than our primary channels, so we appreciate your patience.
