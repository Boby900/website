Neon offers the following plans: **Free Tier**, **Pro**, and **Custom**. The Pro plan is _usage-based_, ensuring you never over-provision and only pay for what you use. **Custom** plans are volume-based, offering potential discounts. The table below provides an overview of plans offered by Neon. For more information about a particular plan, refer to the individual plan pages:

- [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier)
- [Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan)
- [Custom plan](/docs/introduction/custom-plan)

**Notes:**

- The Pro plan has default limits of 20 projects, 200 GB of storage, and 20 simultaneously active computes. To increase these limits, reach out to our [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) team. The simultaneously active compute limit does not affect the primary branch compute.
- The Free Tier provides 100 hours of monthly [Active time](/docs/reference/glossary#active-time) for all compute branches. Upon reaching this limit, your non-primary computes are subject to suspension until the start of the next month. **Your primary branch compute remains available** if you exceed this limit, ensuring uninterrupted access to data on your primary branch. For more information, see [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier).
