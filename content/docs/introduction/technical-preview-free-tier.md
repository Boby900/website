Neon is currently in Technical Preview. For information about how the Technical Preview fits within Neon's release plans, refer to the [Neon roadmap](/docs/reference/roadmap).

The Neon Free Tier is intended for a personal project, small website, prototyping, or evaluation.

The Free Tier includes:

- One Neon project
- Up to 10 branches including the [primary branch](/docs/reference/glossary#primary-branch)
- 3 GB of storage per branch
- A shared compute with 1 GB of RAM
- A [point-in-time restore](/docs/reference/glossary#point-in-time-restore) window of 7 days

For increased limits and added features, upgrade to our **Pro** plan. see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/billing#neon-plans) for more information.

<Admonition type="note">
Neon reserves the right to adjust Free Tier limits, and to discontinue access in exceptional cases where misuse is identified, in order to protect the integrity of our platform and ensure a positive experience for all users.
