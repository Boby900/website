In most cases, copying a connection string from the Neon **Dashboard** and using it in your project should work as is. However, with older clients and some native PostgreSQL clients, you may receive the following error:

```txt
ERROR: The endpoint ID is not specified. Either upgrade the PostgreSQL client library (libpq) for SNI support or pass the endpoint ID (the first part of the domain name) as a parameter: '&options=endpoint%3D'. See [https://neon.tech/sni](https://neon.tech/sni) for more information.
```

In most cases, this happens if your client library or application does not support the **Server Name Indication (SNI)** mechanism in TLS. See [How Neon routes connections](#how-neon-routes-connections) for more context and [Workarounds](#workarounds) for a list of ways to work around the SNI requirement.

## How Neon routes connections

Neon uses compute endpoint domain names to route incoming connections. For example, to connect to the compute endpoint `ep-mute-recipe-239816`, we ask you to connect to `ep-mute-recipe-239816.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`. However, the PostgreSQL wire protocol does not transfer the server domain name, so Neon relies on the SNI extension of the `TLS` protocol to do this. This is the same mechanism that allows hosting several `https`-enabled websites on a single IP address. Unfortunately, not all PostgreSQL clients support SNI. When these clients attempt to connect, they receive the "endpoint ID is not specified" error mentioned above.

SNI support was added to the `libpq` (an official PostgreSQL client library) in version 14, released in September 2021. All `libpq`-based clients like Python's `psycopg2` and Ruby's `ruby-pg` should work if the system `libpq` version is >= 14.

## Workarounds

If you encounter the `endpoint ID is not specified` error, and a library or application upgrade does not help, we provide several workarounds for client connections to provide the required domain name information.

### A. Pass the endpoint ID as an option

We support a special connection option named `endpoint`, which you can set to identify the compute endpoint you are connecting to. Specifically, you can pass `options=endpoint%3Dep-mute-recipe-239816` as a parameter in the connection string. The `%3D` is a URL-encoded `=`.

<Admonition type="note">
The special connection option was previously named `project`. The `project` option is deprecated but remains supported for backward compatibility.
</Admonition>

For example, instead of the following connection string:

```txt
postgres://<user>:<password>@ep-mute-recipe-239816.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/main
```

You would use this one:

```txt
postgres://<user>:<password>@ep-mute-recipe-239816.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/main?options=endpoint%3Dep-mute-recipe-239816
```

The `endpoint` option is expected to work if your application or library permits it to be set. But not all of them do, especially in the case of GUI applications.

### B. Use libpq key=value syntax in the database field

If your application or client is `libpq`-based and you can't easily upgrade the library, such as when the library is compiled inside of a pre-built application, you can take advantage of the fact that `libpq` permits adding options to the database name. So, in addition to the database name, you can specify:

```txt
dbname=neondb options=endpoint=<endpoint_id>
```

This workaround is expected to work with all `libpq`-based applications.

### C. Set verify-full for golang-based clients

If your application or service uses golang PostgreSQL clients like `pgx` and `lib/pg`, you can set `sslmode=verify-full`, which causes SNI information to be sent. Most likely, this behavior is not intentional but happens inadvertently due to the golang's TLS library API design.

### D. Specify the endpoint ID in the password field

You can specify the endpoint ID in the password field as a last resort. So, instead of your actual password, you define a string consisting of the endpoint and the password. For example:

```txt
endpoint=ep-mute-recipe-239816;<password>
```

This approach is the least secure of all the recommended workarounds. It causes the authentication method to be downgraded from `scram-sha-256` (never transfers a plain text password) to `password` (transfers a plain text password) on the fly. The connection is still TLS-encrypted, so the amount of security is the same as with `https` websites. However, we intend deprecate this option when most libraries and applications provide SNI support.
