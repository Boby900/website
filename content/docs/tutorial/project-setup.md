The steps that follow describe how to sign up for Neon, create a Neon project, and add data using the Neon **SQL Editor**. You are also introduced to the Neon **Tables** feature, which allows you to explore your data from the Neon Console.

## Create a Neon account

If you do not have a Neon account, navigate to the [Neon sign-in page](https://console.neon.tech/sign_in) and create one using your GitHub or Google account.

When you sign up, you are automatically enrolled in Neon's [Free Tier](../introduction/technical-preview-free-tier). If you require larger compute and storage limits, Neon also offers paid plans. For more information, see [Neon plans](../introduction/plans).

## Create a project

After you sign in:

1. Click **Create a project**.
2. Enter a name for your project or let Neon generate one for you.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

You may have noticed that your project was created in just a few seconds. That’s one of the benefits of Neon’s serverless architecture. Neon is serverless PostgreSQL that separates compute and storage. A Neon compute is a stateless PostgreSQL instance, which allows Neon to provision PostgreSQL very quickly.

Another benefit of Neon's serverless architecture is that Neon can scale compute resources to zero after a period of inactivity to save on compute costs. This feature, called _Auto-suspend_, suspends a compute after five minutes of inactivity, by default.

If you navigate to the **Branches** page in the Neon Console, you can watch how a compute switches between `Active` and `Idle` states. Active means that the compute is running. `Idle` means that the compute is suspended.

To learn more about Neon's serverless architecture, refer to the [Neon architecture](../introduction/architecture-overview/) documentation.

## Create a table

This tutorial uses a table called `elements`, which contains data from the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table). The example is based on the [Neon with Next.js and Prisma application](https://github.com/neondatabase/examples/tree/main/with-nextjs-prisma), which you can find in our [examples repo](https://github.com/neondatabase/examples) on GitHub.

In the following steps, you will use the Neon **SQL Editor** to create the `elements` table. The **SQL Editor** allows you to query your databases directly from the Neon Console. For more information about this feature, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](../get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

To create the `elements` table:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. Select your project.
3. Select **SQL Editor** from the sidebar.
4. Select a branch and a database. This tutorial uses the `main` branch and the default `neondb` database that is created with each Neon project.
5. Enter the following query into the editor and click **Run** or use the `⌘+Enter` shortcut.

```sql
CREATE TABLE elements (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  elementName TEXT NOT NULL,
  atomicNumber INTEGER NOT NULL,
  symbol TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

The editor should report that the request ran successfully.

## Insert data

In this step, you will add data to the `elements` table. In the **SQL Editor**, click **New Query** to clear the editor, and run the following `INSERT` query to add data to your table:

```sql
INSERT INTO elements (id, elementName, atomicNumber, symbol)
VALUES
  (1, 'Hydrogen', 1, 'H'),
  (2, 'Helium', 2, 'He'),
  (3, 'Lithium', 3, 'Li'),
  (4, 'Beryllium', 4, 'Be'),
  (5, 'Boron', 5, 'B'),
  (6, 'Carbon', 6, 'C'),
  (7, 'Nitrogen', 7, 'N'),
  (8, 'Oxygen', 8, 'O'),
  (9, 'Fluorine', 9, 'F'),
  (10, 'Neon', 10, 'Ne');
```

## View your data

To view the data that you added, you can use the **Tables** feature in the Neon console, which allows you to explore the data in your Neon databases.

Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select the `elements` table. The data you inserted should be visible.
