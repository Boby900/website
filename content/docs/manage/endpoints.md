A single read-write compute endpoint is created for your project's [primary branch](/docs/reference/glossary#primary-branch), by default.

To connect to a database that resides in a branch, you must connect via a compute endpoint associated with the branch. The following diagram shows the project's primary branch (`main`) and a child branch, both of which have an associated compute endpoint.

```text
Project
    |----primary branch (main) ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
             |    |
             |    |---- database (neondb)
             |
             ---- child branch ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
                            |
                            |---- database (mydb)
```

Neon supports both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are also referred to as [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints.

Tier limits define resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute endpoint. The  [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) provides a shared vCPU and up to 1 GB of RAM per compute endpoint. The [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) supports larger compute sizes and autoscaling.

## View a compute endpoint

A compute endpoint is associated with a branch. To view a compute endpoint, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. If the branch has a compute endpoint, it is shown on the branch page.

Compute endpoint details shown on the branch page include:

- **Id**: The compute endpoint ID.
-- **Type**: The type of compute endpoint. `R/W` (Read-write) or `R/O` (Read-only).
- **Status**: The compute endpoint status (`Active`, `Idle`, or `Stopped`).
- **Compute size**: The size of the compute endpoint. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the amount of vCPU and RAM for a compute endpoint when creating or editing a compute endpoint. Shows autoscaling minimum and maximum vCPU values if autoscaling is enabled.
- **Auto-suspend delay**: The number of seconds of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). For more information, see [Autosuspend configuration](#auto-suspend-configuration).
- **Last active**: The date and time the compute was last active.

## Create a compute endpoint

You can only create a read-write compute endpoint for a branch that does not have one, but a branch can have multiple read-only compute endpoints (referred to as "read replicas"). [Read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide) are a [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature.

To create an endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch that does not have an endpoint
1. Click **Add compute**.
1. On the **Create compute endpoint** dialog, specify your settings and click **Create**. Selecting **Read-only** creates a [Read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

## Edit a compute endpoint

Neon paid plan users can edit a compute endpoint to change the [compute size](#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) or [Autosuspend](#auto-suspend-configuration) configuration.

To edit a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the kebab menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Edit**.
   
   The **Edit** window opens, letting you take a range of actions, depending on your tier.
1. Once you've made your changes, click **Save**. All changes take immediate effect.

### What happens to the endpoint when making changes
Some key points to understand about how your endpoint responds when you make changes to your compute settings:

* Changing the size of your fixed compute restarts the endpoint and _temporarily disconnects all existing connections_. 
  <Admonition type="note">
  When your compute resizes automatically as part of the autoscaling feature, there are no restarts or disconnects; it just scales. 
  </Admonition>
* Editing minimum or maximum autoscaling sizes also requires a restart; existing connections are temporarily disconnected.
* Changes to autosuspend settings do not require an endpoint restart; existing connections are unaffected.

### Compute size and autoscaling configuration

[Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can change compute size settings when [editing a compute endpoint](#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

_Compute size_ is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute endpoint. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute endpoint. One CU has 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CUs have 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the number of CUs, as shown in the table below. Currently, a Neon compute can have anywhere from 1/4 (.25) to 7 CUs.

| Compute Units | vCPU | RAM    |
|:--------------|:-----|:-------|
| .25           | .25  | 1 GB   |
| .5            | .5   | 2 GB   |
| 1             | 1    | 4 GB   |
| 2             | 2    | 8 GB   |
| 3             | 3    | 12 GB  |
| 4             | 4    | 16 GB  |
| 5             | 5    | 20 GB  |
| 6             | 6    | 24 GB  |
| 7             | 7    | 28 GB  |

Neon supports two compute size configuration options:

- **Fixed Size:** This option allows you to select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
- **Autoscaling:** This option allows you to specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries to meet workload demand. _Autoscaling_ currently supports a range of 1/4 (.25) to 7 CUs. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

<Admonition type="info">
The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function you can use to monitor how the _Autoscaling_ feature allocates compute resources in response to workload. For more information, see [The neon_utils extension](/docs/extensions/neon-utils).
</Admonition>

### Autosuspend configuration

Neon's _Autosuspend_ feature automatically transitions a compute endpoint into an `Idle` state after a period of inactivity, also known as "scale-to-zero". By default, suspension occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity, but this delay can be adjusted. For instance, you can increase the delay to reduce the frequency of suspensions, or you can disable autosuspend completely to maintain an "always-active" compute endpoint. An "always-active" configuration eliminates the few seconds of latency required to reactivate a compute endpoint but is likely to increase your compute time usage.

The maximum **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting is 7 days. To configure a compute as "always-active", deselect **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity**. For more information, refer to [Configuring autosuspend for Neon computes](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).

## Restart a compute endpoint

It is sometimes necessary to restart a compute endpoint. For example, if you upgrade to a Neon Pro Plan account, you may want to restart your compute endpoint to immediately apply your upgraded limits.

<Admonition type="important">
Please be aware that restarting a compute endpoint interrupts any connections currently using the compute endpoint.
</Admonition>

You can restart a compute endpoint using one of the following methods:

- Stop activity on your compute endpoint (stop running queries) and wait for your compute endpoint to suspend due to inactivity. By default, Neon suspends a compute after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can watch the status of your compute on the **Branches** page in the Neon console. Select your branch and monitor your compute's **Status** field. Wait for it to report an `Idle` status. The compute will restart the next time it's accessed, and the status will change to `Active`. 
- Issue [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/suspendprojectendpoint) and [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) API calls. You can do this directly from the [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), using the **Try It!** feature. You'll need an [API key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- Neon Pro Plan users can temporarily set a compute's **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting to 1 second to initiate a restart (the default setting is 5 minutes). See [Autosuspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) for instructions. After doing so, check the **Operations** page in the Neon Console to see if your compute endpoint restarted. Look for `suspend_compute` and `start_compute` actions.

## Delete a compute endpoint

Deleting a compute endpoint is a permanent action.

To delete a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the kebab menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage compute endpoints with the Neon API

Compute endpoint actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete compute endpoints using the Neon API. For other compute endpoint API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a compute endpoint with the API

The following Neon API method creates a compute endpoint.

```http
POST /projects/{project_id}/endpoints
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The branch you specify cannot have an existing compute endpoint. A compute endpoint must be associated with a branch, and a branch can have only one compute endpoint. Neon  supports read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are for creating [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/endpoints' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
