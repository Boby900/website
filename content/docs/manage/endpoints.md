A single read-write compute endpoint is created for your project's [primary branch](../reference/glossary#primary-branch), by default.

To connect to a database that resides in a branch, you must connect via a compute endpoint associated with the branch. The following diagram shows the project's primary branch (`main`) and a child branch, both of which have an associated compute endpoint.

```text
Project
    |----primary branch (main) ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
             |    |
             |    |---- database (neondb)
             |
             ---- child branch ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
                            |
                            |---- database (mydb)
```

Tier limits define resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute endpoint. The Neon [Free Tier](../introduction/technical-preview-free-tier) provides a shared vCPU and up to 1 GB of RAM per compute endpoint.

## View a compute endpoint

A compute endpoint is associated with a branch. To view a compute endpoint, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. If the branch has a compute endpoint, it is shown on the branch page.

Compute endpoint details shown on the branch page include:

- **Host**: The compute endpoint hostname.
- **Region**: The region where the compute endpoint resides.
- **Type**: The type of compute endpoint. Currently, only `read_write` compute endpoints are supported.
- **Compute size**: The size of the compute endpoint. Neon [Pro plan](../introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the amount of vCPU and RAM for a compute endpoint when creating or editing a compute endpoint.
- **Compute size (min)**: The minimum compute size for the compute endpoint. This column appears when the [Autoscaling](../introduction/autoscaling) feature is enabled, which is only available to Neon Pro plan users.
- **Compute size (max)**: The maximum compute size for the compute endpoint. This column appears when the Autoscaling feature is enabled, which is only available to Neon Pro plan users.
- **Auto-suspend delay**: The number of seconds of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). For more information, see [Auto-suspend configuration](#auto-suspend-configuration).
- **Last active**: The date and time the compute was last active.
- **Status**: The compute endpoint status (`Active`, `Idle`, or `Stopped`).

## Create a compute endpoint

You can only create a compute endpoint for a branch that does not have one.

To create an endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch that does not have an endpoint
1. Click **Add new compute endpoint**.
1. On the **Create compute endpoint** dialog, choose whether to enable connection pooling and click **Create**.

For more information connection pooling in Neon, see [Connection pooling](../connect/connection-pooling).

## Edit a compute endpoint

Neon paid plan users can edit a compute endpoint to change the [compute size](#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) or [Auto-suspend](#auto-suspend-configuration) configuration.

To edit a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the compute endpoint kebab menu, and select **Edit**.
1. Specify your changes and click **Save**.

<Admonition type="note">
Enabling connection pooling for a compute endpoint is deprecated. You can enable connection pooling for individual connections instead. For more information, see [Enable connection pooling](../connect/connection-pooling#enable-connection-pooling).
</Admonition>

### Compute size and Autoscaling configuration

Neon [Pro plan](../introduction/pro-plan) users can change compute size settings when [editing a compute endpoint](#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

_Compute size_ is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute endpoint. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute endpoint. One CU is equal to 1 vCPU with 4 GBs of RAM. Currently, a Neon compute endpoint can have anywhere from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. Larger compute sizes will be supported in a future release.

Neon supports two compute size configuration options:

- **Fixed Size:** This option allows you to select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
- **Autoscaling:** This option allows you to specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries to meet workload demand. _Autoscaling_ currently supports a range of 1/4 CU to 7 CU. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](../introduction/autoscaling).

### Auto-suspend configuration

Neon's _Auto-suspend_ feature automatically transitions a compute endpoint into an `Idle` state after a period of inactivity, also known as "scale-to-zero". By default, suspension occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity, but this delay can be adjusted. For instance, you can increase the delay to reduce the frequency of suspensions, or you can disable _Auto-suspend_ completely to maintain an "always-active" compute endpoint. An "always-active" configuration eliminates the few seconds of latency required to reactivate a compute endpoint but is likely to increase your compute time usage.

The maximum **Auto-suspend delay** setting is 604800 seconds (7 days), and the following settings have a special meaning:

- `0` means use the default setting (5 minutes / 300 seconds).
- `-1` means never suspend the compute endpoint.

## Delete a compute endpoint

Deleting a compute endpoint is a permanent action.

To delete a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the compute endpoint kebab menu, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage compute endpoints with the Neon API

Compute endpoint actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete compute endpoints using the Neon API. For other compute endpoint API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](../manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a compute endpoint with the API

The following Neon API method creates a compute endpoint.

```text
POST /projects/{project_id}/endpoints
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The branch you specify cannot have an existing compute endpoint. A compute endpoint must be associated with a branch, and a branch can have only one compute endpoint. Neon currently supports read-write compute endpoints only.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/endpoints' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \

### Update a compute endpoint with the API

The following Neon API method updates the specified compute endpoint. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectendpoint).

```text
PATCH /projects/{project_id}/endpoints/{endpoint_id}
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The example reassigns the compute endpoint to another branch by changing the `branch_id`. The branch that you specify cannot have an existing compute endpoint. A compute endpoint must be associated with a branch, and a branch can have only one compute endpoint.

```bash
curl -X 'PATCH' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/endpoints/ep-young-art-646685' \
