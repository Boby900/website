## Connection pooling support

Neon supports connection pooling with PgBouncer via a pooled connection string. A pooled connection string has a `-pooler` suffix in the Neon endpoint hostname, as shown:

```text
postgres://sally:<password>@ep-throbbing-boat-918849-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb
```
