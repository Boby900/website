Neon allows you to instantly branch your data in the same way that you branch your code. You can quickly and cost-effectively branch your data for development, testing, staging, and various of other purposes, enabling you to improve developer productivity and optimize continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. See [Branching workflows](#branching-workflows) for a discussion of different ways you can integrate branching into your development workflows.

_Neon Branching capabilities are not yet publicly available. If you would like to try this feature, reach out to [iwantbranching@neon.tech](mailto:iwantbranching@neon.tech) describing your use case and requesting that Neon enable branching for your account._

## What is a branch?

A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data. You can create a branch from a current or past state. For example, you can create a branch that includes all data up to the current point in time or up to a past point in time or [Log Sequence Number (LSN)](../../reference/glossary#lsn).

A branch is isolated from its originating data, so you are free to play around with it, modify it, and delete it when it's no longer needed. Changes to a branch are independent of the originating data. A branch and its parent share the same history but diverge at the point of branch creation. Writes to a branch are saved as an independent delta.

Creating a branch does not increase load on the parent branch or affect it in any way, which means that you can create a branch at any time without impacting the performance of your production system.

An endpoint is created for each branch, which is the compute instance associated with the branch. A branch endpoint is read-write. To connect to a branch from a client or application, you must connect to the branch endpoint. For more information, see [Getting started with branches](../../getting-started-with-neon/get-started-branching).

## Branching workflows

You can use Neon's branching feature in variety development workflows, a few of which are discussed below.

### Development

You can create a branch of your production database that developers are free to play with and modify. You can quickly create a branch with all of the data that existed in the parent branch, eliminating the setup time required to deploy and maintain a development database. Branching is so easy and cost-effective that you can create a branch for each developer. For example, you can create branches from a primary development branch to assign tasks to be worked on in parallel.

### Testing

Branching enables testers to use the most recent production data. Testers can create branches for testing schema changes, validating new queries, or testing potentially destructive queries before deploying them into production. A branch is isolated from its parent branch but has all of the parent branch's data up to the point of branch creation, which eliminates the effort involved in hydrating a database. Tests can also run on separate branches in parallel, with each branch having dedicated compute resources.

Another testing scenario enabled by branching is tracking down corruption or data quality issue. For example, you can create and dispose of multiple point-in-time database branches to determine when the corruption or data quality issue first appeared.

### Staging

With Neon's branching capabilities, you can create a staging database by branching your production database. Using the Neon API, you can automate creating a database branch based on the staging branch for every pull request in your CI/CD pipeline.

### Data recovery

If you lose data due to an unintended deletion or some other event, you can create a branch with data as it existed before the event occurred, allowing you to recover the lost data.

### Analytics

You can run costly, long-running queries on an isolated branch of your production data, each with its own compute resources. With automation scripts, you can create and dispose of branches on a defined schedule to ensure that queries always run on an up-to-date copy of your production data.

### Machine Learning

You can create point-in-time branches to ensure repeatability when training machine learning models.

## Get started with branching
