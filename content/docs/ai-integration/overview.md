As artificial intelligence continues to evolve rapidly, it has become increasingly important for businesses and developers to harness its potential to enhance their applications and services. Neon recognizes the value of AI integration and is dedicated to developing tools and features that enable seamless integration with cutting-edge AI technologies. In this AI integration section, you'll find information to help you integrate AI capabilities with Neon, such as setting up a ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin, building an AI-powered chatbot, using the `pg_tiktoken` extension to efficiently tokenize and manage text tokens in PostgreSQL, and leveraging the `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search and embeddings storage. By diving into these resources, you'll gain invaluable insights into how you can fully exploit the power of AI to elevate your Neon-based applications to new heights.

[Set up a ChatPGT Retrieval Plugin](tbd)

Learn how to set up and run the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin using Neon for semantic search and document retrieval. Follow step-by-step instructions for installing dependencies, configuring the `pgvector` extension, setting environment variables, and running the API locally to build powerful chatbot applications.

[Build an AI-powered chatbot](tbd)

Discover the potential of large language models like ChatGPT and OpenAI API for your business. Learn about word embeddings, the role of the `pgvector` PostgreSQL extension, and creating a chatbot API using Neon and Vercel Edge Functions. See how Ask Neon, a ChatGPT-inspired app, effectively answers Postgres and Neon-related queries.

[pg_tiktoken](tbd)

Leverage the `pg_tiktoken` extension to efficiently tokenize and manage text tokens in PostgreSQL using OpenAI's `tiktoken` library. Learn how to install the extension, use `tiktoken_count` and `tiktoken_encode` functions, and seamlessly integrate it with OpenAI's language models for various natural language processing applications.

[pgvector](tbd)

Dive into the `pgvector` extension, a powerful tool for vector similarity search and embeddings storage in PostgreSQL databases. Learn about vector similarity, embeddings, enabling and optimizing the extension, creating tables, storing and querying vectors, and improving performance through indexing. Enhance your applications, especially those leveraging OpenAI's GPT models, with `pgvector` advanced features.
