The Neon API allows you to manage projects programmatically, which is helpful when using Neon as a part of a CI/CD pipeline.

Refer to the [Neon API reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/) for supported methods.

<Admonition type="important">
[Neon API v1](https://console.neon.tech/api/v1) is now deprecated. Support for it will be removed in a future release. Please migrate your applications to the new [Neon API](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2). The base URL for the new Neon API is `https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/`.
</Admonition>

Accessing the Neon API requires an API key. To obtain an API key, refer to the instructions in [Using API keys](/docs/get-started-with-neon/using-api-keys/).
