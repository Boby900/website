Neon's [Auto-suspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend) feature controls when a Neon compute instance transitions to an `Idle` state (scales to zero) due to inactivity. This guide demonstrates how to configure the _Auto-suspend_ setting in your Neon project.

You can configure the _Auto-suspend_ setting in an existing project by editing a compute endpoint. You can also configure it when you first create a Neon project, which sets the _Auto-suspend_ default for the project. Both methods are described below.

## Configure Auto-suspend for a compute endpoint

[Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can edit an individual compute endpoint to adjust the _Auto-suspend_ configuration.

To edit a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the compute endpoint kebab menu, and select **Edit**.

1. Under **Compute size**, enter the desired **Auto-suspend delay** setting. The value is specified in seconds. The maximum setting is `604800` seconds (7 days). A value of `0` is equivalent to the global default value of `300` seconds (5 minutes). A value of `-1` turns off the _Auto-suspend_ feature, which means that the compute remains active.

    You can configure **Autoscaling** settings for your compute endpoint at the same time. For more information, see [Enable Autoscaling in Neon](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide).

1. Click **Save**.

## Set the Auto-suspend default when creating a project

A project is a top-level object in the Neon object hierarchy. You can think of it as a container for all other objects, including branches and compute endpoints.

Enabling _Auto-suspend_ when you create a project allows you to set the _Auto-suspend_ default setting for all compute endpoints created in your project. You can adjust _Auto-suspend_ setting for individual compute endpoints afterward, but setting a default when creating a project saves you from having to configure this setting for each compute later on.

To configure the _Auto-suspend_ default setting at project creation time:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create a project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.
1. Specify a name, a Postgres version, and a region.
1. Under **Compute size**, enter the desired **Auto-suspend delay** setting.

    You can configure default **Autoscaling** settings at the same time. For more information, see [Enable Autoscaling in Neon](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide).

1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Create Project**. Your initial compute endpoint is created with the specified setting. All compute endpoints created in the future when creating a branch or adding a compute endpoint to a branch are created with this setting.

## Monitor compute status

You can monitor compute status on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A compute reports either an **Active** or **Idle** status.

You can also view compute state transitions in the **Branches** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

User actions that activate an idle compute include [connecting from a client such as psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), running a query on your database from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), or accessing the compute via the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

The Neon API includes [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) and [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) APIs for the specific purpose of activating and suspending a compute.

You can try any of these methods and watch the status of your compute as it transitions from an **Idle** to an **Active** state.
