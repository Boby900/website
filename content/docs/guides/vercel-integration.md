title: How the integration works with preview deployments

Vercel [preview deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments) enable teams to collaborate effectively by automatically creating an isolated, production-like environment for every commit. This way, all changes can be previewed before they are merged into production.

However, when databases are involved, teams often share a single database containing dummy data across all preview deployments. This setup is not ideal for these reasons:

- If the shared database encounters an issue, so will all preview deployments.
- Changes to the shared database schema might break all previously created preview deployments, making it a productivity bottleneck.

Neonâ€™s branching feature addresses all of these challenges. A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data, so creating it only takes a few seconds. This makes it a scalable and cost-effective solution for preview deployments, enabling you to create a branch for each pull request.

When you push a branch to the GitHub repository associated with your Vercel project, triggering a preview deployment, the integration automatically creates a database branch in Neon and connects it to your preview deployment by setting the required Vercel preview environment variables. The newly created Neon branch will have same name as the Git branch containing the code changes.

For a demo app that you can use to try the Neon-Vercel integration, refer to [Deploy a Next.js app with Prisma and Vercel](/docs/guides/vercel-app), which demonstrates the integration with the [naturesnap](https://github.com/neondatabase/naturesnap) application.
