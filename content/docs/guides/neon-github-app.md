The Neon GitHub integration connects your GitHub application repository to your Neon project, making it easier to set up developer workflows using Neon's [GitHub Actions](/docs/guides/branching-github-actions) or other CI/CD tools.

<Admonition type="comingSoon" title="Feature Coming Soon">
The Neon GitHub integration is currently in **private preview**. To start using it, request access by contacting our [Customer Success](mailto:customer-success@neon.tech) team and asking to join the private preview.
</Admonition>

When you connect your GitHub application repository to your Neon project, the integration performs the following actions:

1. Creates a GitHub variable containing your Neon project ID.
2. Generates a new Neon API key for your Neon account.
3. Creates a GitHub secret containing the Neon API key.

<Admonition type="info">
Neon's GitHub Actions require setting a `NEON_PROJECT_ID` variable and a `NEON_API_KEY` secret in GitHub. The Neon GitHub app does this for you automatically.
</Admonition>   

The following section describes how to install the GitHub integration.

## Prerequisites

This installation described below assumes the following:

- You already have a Neon account and project. If not, see [Sign up for a Neon account](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- You have a GitHub account and a repository that you want to connect to your Neon project.

## Install the GitHub integration

<Admonition type="note">
If you previously installed the integration for a different Neon project, remove the previous integration before installing. For instructions, see [Remove the GitHub integration](/docs/guides/neon-github-app#remove-the-github-integration).
</Admonition>

To add the GitHub integration to your Neon project:

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page for your project.
2. Locate the **GitHub** integration card and click **Add**.
    ![GitHub integration card](/docs/guides/github_card.png)
3. On the **GitHub integration** drawer, click **Install GitHub app**.
4. On the **Install & Authorize** page, select whether to install and authorize the GitHub app for **All repositories** or **Only select repositories**.
    - Selecting **All repositories** directs you back to the GitHub integration drawer in the Neon Console to select a GitHub repository.
    - Selecting **Only select repositories** lets you choose a repository immediately.
5. Since Neon's GitHub app is currently designed to work with a single repository, select **Only select repositories** and choose a GitHub repository from the **Select repositories** drop-down list.
6. Click **Install & Authorize** to complete the installation.

You are directed back to the GitHub integration drawer in the Neon Console.

### Changes made by the integration

This section describes where to find the changes made by the Neon GitHub integration to your GitHub and Neon accounts.

- **Installed and Authorized GitHub Apps**

    To view the installed and authorized Neon GitHub application:
    
    1. Navigate to your GitHub account page.
    2. From your GitHub profile menu, select **Settings**.
    3. Select **Applications** from the sidebar. 

    The Neon GitHub app should be listed on the **Installed GitHub Apps** and **Authorized GitHub Apps** tabs.

- **Neon project ID variable and Neon API key secret**

    To view the variable containing your Neon project ID:

    1. Navigate to your GitHub account page.
    2. From your GitHub profile menu, select **Your repositories**.
    3. Select the repository that you chose when installing the Neon GitHub integration.
    4. On the repository page, select the **Settings** tab.
    5. Select **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** from the sidebar.
    
    Your `NEON_API_KEY` secret is listed on the **Secrets** tab, and the `NEON_PROJECT_ID` variable is listed on the **Variables** tab.

- **Neon API key**

    To view the Neon API key created by the integration:

    1. In the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech), click your profile at the top right corner of the page.
    2. Select **Account settings**.
    2. Select **API keys**.

    The API key created by the integration should be listed with a name similar to the following: **API key for GitHub (cool-darkness-12345678)**. You cannot view the key itself, only the name it was given, the time it was created, and when the key was last used.

    <Admonition type="note">
    The items listed above are removed if you uninstall the Neon GitHub integration. See [Remove the GitHub integration](#remove-the-github-integration).

## Using the GitHub integration

The GitHub integration is intended to simplify setting up developer workflows using Neon's [GitHub Actions](/docs/guides/branching-github-actions) or other CI/CD tools. Neon's GitHub Actions require the configuration steps performed by the Neon GitHub integration to be performed manually, namely:

1. Creating a GitHub variable containing your Neon project ID.
2. Generating a new Neon API key for your Neon account.
3. Creating a GitHub secret containing the Neon API key.

After installing the Neon GitHub integration, you can proceed with setting up your GitHub Action workflow knowing that these steps are already completed.

For example applications that use Neon's GitHub Actions, see [Example applications](/docs/guides/branching-github-actions#example-applications).

<Admonition type="note">
This is an early preview of the Neon GitHub integration. Its functionality is currently limited to configuring a project ID variable and Neon API Key secret. You may find that you need to configure additional variables and secrets when building workflows. When you run into a limitation, please let us know and we'll consider it for the next release. See [Feedback and future improvements](#feedback-and-future-improvements).

## Remove the GitHub integration

Removing the integration performs the following actions:

- Terminates connections dependent on the configured variable and secret.
- Removes the GitHub variable containing your Neon project ID.
- Removes the Neon API key for your Neon account.
- Removes the GitHub secret containing the Neon API key.

To remove the integration:

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page for your project.
2. Locate the GitHub integration and click **Manage** to open the **GitHub integration** drawer.
3. Click **Disconnect**.
4. Click **Remove integration** to confirm your choice.
